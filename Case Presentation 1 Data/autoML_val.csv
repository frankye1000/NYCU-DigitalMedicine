discharge date: 6/1/1999
principal diagnosis: non q-wave myocardial infarction.
chief complaint: the patient is a 60-year-old woman who was
admitted for chest pain.
history of present illness: the patient has a history of diabetes
mellitus , cerebrovascular accident in
1994 , gastroesophageal reflux disease , recurrent transient ischemic
attack , who was in her usual state of health until the day prior to
admission when she developed chest burning 3 days ago. the
symptoms were associated with nausea. she tried maalox and h2
blocker without relief. the patient had stuttering symptoms off
and on throughout the day and night without relief. she was
brought in to bmc today , given aspirin , sublingual nitroglycerin
and transferred to the montexo medical center for further
evaluation. in the emergency room , her systolic blood pressure is
130. she was tachycardic , and she was given iv nitroglycerin. the
patient then became hypotensive due to overaggressive
nitroglycerin. the patient received inderal for tachycardia. no
tirofiban was given given her history of cerebrovascular accident.
her chest burning was not resolved with iv nitroglycerin. she was
given morphine sulfate x 2 mg , inderal and an esmolol drip.
past medical history: 1. hypothyroidism. 2. diabetes mellitus.
3. hypertension. 4. borderline personality
disorder. 5. gastroesophageal reflux disease. 6. parathyroid
adenoma. 6. status post total abdominal hysterectomy. 7. history
of migraine headache. 8. chronic re-elevated liver function tests.
medications: 1. atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d. 2. insulin 70/30.
3. regular insulin. 4. nph. 5. metformin. 6.
valium. 7. aspirin. 8. synthroid.
allergies: penicillin , novocaine , aldactone which all give hives.
family history: mother with cva at age 21.
social history: she is a schoolteacher. no alcohol or tobacco
use.
physical examination: blood pressure 132/84. heart rate 94.
o2 saturation 93% on 2 liters. sclerae were
anicteric. the lungs were clear. heart was tachycardic , regular
with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. abdomen was with slight
hepatomegaly. normal bowel sounds with slight right upper quadrant
pain. lower extremities were without edema.
laboratory data: ck 336 with an mb of 9.7. troponin was 8.4.
chem-7 was normal with a bun of 8 and a
creatinine of 0.9. hematocrit was 42. white count was 7.
platelets 196. ekg showed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis
deviation , normal intervals. there were q-waves inferiorly and
anteriorly with poor r-wave progression and persistent s in v6.
there were slight st segment increased elevations in v2 of 1 mm and
t-wave inversions in v2 through v6.
hospital course: due to her history of cerebrovascular accident ,
no thrombolysis was attempted. she was admitted
to the coronary care unit and treated overnight with increased
dosages of beta blocker and had intermittent symptoms. she went to
catheterization and was found to have 100% left anterior descending
with right to left collaterals and poor distal flow as well as a
90% mid and 90% distal right coronary artery with significant
vessel tortuosity. the left anterior descending was percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplastied with question of distal
dissection which required stent placement. it led to initial good
result. a wire was passed through the stent , but no balloon could
be passed. there was no proximal stent placed due to poor outflow.
the plan was to return to catheterization laboratory to attempt
right coronary artery stenting. however , she subsequently spiked a
temperature to 103 degrees fahrenheit. she was pan cultured and
her sheaths were removed. no antibiotics were started at that
time. her urine subsequently grew greater than 100 , 000 e. coli ,
and she was started on levofloxacin with plan for a repeat
catheterization once afebrile x 24 hours. she underwent repeat
catheterization and had percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the right coronary artery lesion. she was
transferred to the floor on 3/3 on the night at the procedure ,
she had an episode of desaturation to the mid 80 percent range on
room air. a chest x-ray revealed a question of congestive heart
failure vs. a right upper lobe infiltrate. she had another fever
to 102.2 , and she was pan cultured. her diuresis was increased at
that time.
on 11/27 , the patient began to show signs of paranoia and
inappropriate behavior , and a psychiatry consultation was obtained.
the patient described visual perception about her room being
smaller and was complaining about changes in her medications
without her being informed. psychiatry felt that she was delirious
and they recommended getting her family more involved to help
reorient the patient. on 3/15 , the patient was oriented and in her
usual state of mental status according to her cardiologist , dr.
greever the patient was demanding to go home at that time. dr.
janikowski preferred to have a dobutamine mibi test performed prior to
her discharge , but it was decided that this could be done at a
later time as an outpatient.
medications on discharge: 1. acyclovir 800 mg po five times a day
for 5 days. 2. aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
3. atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d. 4. synthroid 175 mcg po q.d. 5.
nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. for chest pain. 6. nitropatch 0.4
mg per hour topical q.d. 7. ranitidine 150 mg po b.i.d. 8.
simvastatin 40 mg po q.h.s. 9. insulin 70/30 30 units subcu q.a.m.
and 18 units subcu q.p.m. 10. plavix 75 mg po q.d. x 30 days.
follow-up care: the patient was to follow-up with her primary care
physician the week of discharge and to follow-up
with dr. tutela the following week. she was to have her thyroid
function tested in 6 weeks. she was advised to check her
fingerstick sugars four times a day , keep a diary of those numbers
in order for her insulin dosage to be adjusted.

patient had an echocardiogram suggestive of a small pericardial
effusion and also perhaps pericarditis. the patient was admitted
to the hospital for further evaluation of his chest pain and to
rule out pericardial tamponade.

egophony with increased fremitus on the right , left lung clear.
cardiovascular examination was tachycardic with regular rhythm , no
murmurs , gallops or rubs appreciated. abdomen was obese , positive
bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , non-distended , no
hepatosplenomegaly appreciated. skin revealed numerous auricular
papules. he also had a circumscribed plaque on his left leg noted
to be old. neurological examination was grossly intact with a mild
hand tremor.
laboratory: laboratory studies on admission revealed a white blood
cell count of 11.4 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelet count
267. sma-7 revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 102 ,
bicarbonate 25 , bun 34 , creatinine 2.1 , glucose 238. creatinine

admission was significant for a supraventricular tachycardia at 140
beats per minute. there were no st segment elevations and no acute
changes. chest x-ray was significant for low volume in the right
lung. the left lung was essentially clear. there was no
compression. echocardiogram on admission was suggestive of
pericardial tamponade.
hospital course: the patient was admitted to general medical
service on november , 2000 and taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory where he was found to have pericardial
tamponade. pericardiocentesis was attempted in the catheterization
laboratory on november , 2000 , however it was complicated by right
ventricular puncture. the patient was transferred to the operating
room emergently on november , 2000 for right ventricular puncture
repair and for pericardial window. the patient was followed by the
surgical service postoperatively until his cardiac and pulmonary
function were stable. he was transferred back to the medical
service on august , 2000 for further evaluation and treatment of
pain and further evaluation of his renal function. hospital course
by treatment issues as follows: 1 ) chronic pain: the patient's
pain was felt to be likely due to chronic back conditions and also
pericardial pain. the patient was given narcotics , however became
somnolent requiring narcan reversal. pain service consultation
suggested a regimen of ultram , vioxx and prednisone. the patient
showed improvement on this regimen. in addition , the patient
received steroid trigger point injections with some symptomatic
relief.
2 ) acute tubular necrosis: on august , 2000 through april ,
2000 , the patient had increase in his creatinine to 2.5 thought to
be of pre-renal etiology secondary to lasix he had received on the
surgical service. he received fluid boluses improving his
creatinine. however , he developed hypernatremic diuresis on september , 2000 through january , 2000 which was thought to be a post
acute trivial necrosis diuresis. he was treated with continuous
intravenous fluids of d5 1/2 normal saline with improvement. by
september , 2000 , his creatinine continued to improve to a level of
1.1 , and the patient's diuresis subsided.

the condition responsible for causing this admission is
congestive heart failure exacerbation. other diagnoses include
left bundle branch block , paresthesias in the fingers , benign
prostatic hypertrophy , prostatic adenocarcinoma , gleason's score
2/4 , c5-c6 and c6-c7 disk disease , status post left nephrectomy
for renal cell carcinoma , hyperplastic polyps in 1993 and also
status post aicd and dual chamber pacer.
history of present illness: the patient is a 73-year-old male
well known to the chf service with long-standing new york heart
association class 3b idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presenting
with shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the last
night prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. the patient first went
to an medical center er then left ama without further treatment after
waiting four hours. he reports increasing cough with white
sputum since 5/8 , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea especially
over the last three days. also there is a questionable increase
in abdominal distention. the patient had been admitted five
times in the last six months with the last admission also for
worsening dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and cough in which he
notably had a tee-guided cardioversion and diuresis. he was
discharged on creatinine of 1.7. the patient freely admits that
he has had dietary indiscretion over the last two months ,
claiming that he has been ""eating like a horse"" with meat and
heavy sauces on pasta. the patient denies chest pain , fevers ,
sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea.
allergies: the patient has allergies to erythromycin and
penicillin , which causes a rash. he also describes an allergy to
contrast.
physical examination: the patient was alert and oriented and in
no acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80
beats per minute. his heent exam was unremarkable. carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. there were no thyromegaly
and his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion.
cardiac exam did demonstrate jvp of about 18 cm and also regular
rate and rhythm with an s1 , s2 as well as an s3 and 1/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. the abdominal exam was notable
for an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatile
palpable liver edge. there was no tenderness to palpation. the
extremities were warm and with 1+ distal pulses and only trace
edema.
laboratory data: on admission were notable for bun of 45 ,
creatinine of 1.6 , k of 4.3 and sodium of 136. the inr was 1.3.
hospital course by systems:
1. cardiovascular. the patient was in volume overload and his
arb and aldactone were held. aggressive diuresis was undertaken
for most of this stay including an iv lasix drip , which was later
weaned to a torsemide iv b.i.d. which was later changed to p.o.
b.i.d. for a questionable reaction to the iv formation in the
form of itchiness. he was also put on zaroxolyn throughout the
stay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was later
discontinued on 7/20/05 for long runs of nsvt that he had
possibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. however ,
dobutamine was started on 2/11/05 and this dosage was increased
gradually over 8/1/05 to 1/19/05 to rate about 3 mcg/kg and
the patient tolerated this dosage fairly well. in addition ,
electrolytes were repleted throughout the stay and the patient
underwent a workup for an lvad placement including pfts ,
peripheral and carotid dopplers and an abdominal ultrasound. he was shown to
have significant aortic vascular disease which was felt to represent a
contra-indication for lvad. discussion ongoing with the patient during his
stay revealed that he would prefer not to have the lvad
even if he were eligible. he understood that he was not likely to live long
with the severity of his heart failure. the decision was later made to send
the patient home with a hickman catheter placed on 11/6/05 , so that he could
receive home dobutamine. in terms of ischemia , the first set of
enzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an active
issue. there were no changes on ekg. in terms of rhythm , the
patient does have history of prior afib , however , he has remained
in normal sinus rhythm , status post cardioversion. he has had
asymptomatic runs of nsvt on the dopamine and less so on the
dobutamine as mentioned above. currently he was paced with an
aicd. we kept the patient on amiodarone and digoxin as well as
on tele.
2. renal: the patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency and is status post left nephrectomy. we monitored
the patient's bun and creatinine while diuresing and although ,
the patient did have an increased bun to about 70 , diuretic
treatment was continued as a primary goal.
3. endo. the patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics ,
putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and nph doses. also
the patient had low tsh. this is probably due to subclinical
hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid.
4. heme. the patient is on coumadin as an outpatient and we
titrated his inr to a goal of 2-3. the patient did have some
nosebleeds on 10/21 and his coumadin was temporarily held , but
restarted again for this goal of 2-3 later. the inr goal was
decreased less than 1.5 where the placement of hickman catheter
with the plan to restart the coumadin after placement.
5. prostate. the patient does have a history of prostate
adenocarcinoma , gleason 2/5 on biopsy in 2004. this has been
discussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient has
refused surgery now with an increased psa , however , we did
consult a urology while the patient was here and it was deemed
that his prostate should not be a major prognostic consideration
given the degree of his heart failure.
physical exam at discharge , in general the patient was
comfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eating
his food comfortably as far as the heent and neck exam his jvp
was about 10 cm. cardiovascular exam showed occasional pvcs and
a loud p2 and s3. in general unchanged from admission.
respiratorywise his lungs were clear to auscultation and breath
sounds were equal bilaterally. his abdomen was somewhat
decreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed.
extremities were warm without edema. pulses were 1+ radial and
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as with admission he did have
some wasted lower extremities.
disposition: the patient will be discharged to home with vna
services. the plan is to follow his inr on coumadin and to
continue to monitor his heart for nsvt while on dobutamine. also
consider an arb or aldactone. the patient has stable kidney
function with decreasing creatinine.
discharge medications:
1. amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
2. digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.i.d.

principal diagnosis: congestive heart failure
secondary diagnoses: 1. pulmonary embolus
2. dilated cardiomyopathy
history of present illness: the patient is a 65 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary
to adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortness
of breath and left pleural effusion. he returns now with increased
cough productive of white phlegm and progressive dyspnea on
exertion. the patient has a history of breast carcinoma in 1989 ,
treated with left lumpectomy x 2 and xrt , accompanied by
chemotherapy completed in early 1990. the patient then presented in
july of 1992 with progressive dyspnea on exertion , found to have
an ejection fraction of 17%. she was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy
felt secondary to adriamycin toxicity. she was then treated with
digoxin , lasix , captopril and coumadin with good result. she had
subsequent development of svt with a rapid ventricular rate of
approximately 180. the patient eventually underwent epep studies
with therapeutic ablation. subsequently she had done quite well
until february of 1994 when she presented with mild cough
productive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and
left-sided heart failure. she was treated with increased lasix and
digoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change in
her symptoms. she was then admitted on 8/7 after she was found to
have a large left-sided pleural effusion. the patient underwent
ultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothorax
requiring chest tube placement. evaluation of the pleural fluid
revealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytology
remaining negative. the patient was treated with ancef for
approximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and then
discharged on 6/20/94. since that time the patient has had no
improvement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which
remains productive of white sputum with occasional ""specks of red""
and progression of her dyspnea on exertion. she is now unable to
go greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea.
this is a significant change from approximately one month ago where
she was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. she has
stable 3 + pillow orthopnea and pedal edema. her weight has
increased only slightly recently. she denies any fever , chills ,
sweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. she does not
anorexia and malaise without myalgias or arthralgias. past medical
history: 1. dilated cardiomyopathy as above. 2. breast carcinoma
as above. 3. hypothyroid 4. depression allergies: no known drug
allergies. habits , distant tobacco use , none since 1967 , no etoh.
medications: digoxin 0.25 mg q day , lasix 80 mg q day , capoten 50
mg t.i.d. , aspirin one per day , synthroid 2 gr. per day , tamoxifen
10 mg b.i.d. , elavil 75 mg q day , k-dur 1 q day. social history:
the patient lives with her boyfriend , she is widowed without
children. she is a semi-retired accounts manager. family history:
there is no family history of cardiac disease.
physical examination: temperature 100.6 , blood pressure 116/65 ,
heart rate is 100 , respiratory rate 18. 02
saturation 90% on room air. the patient is alert , responsive ,
febrile and in no acute distress. her conjunctiva are clear ,
extraocular movements intact , her oropharynx is clear. she has no
lymphadenopathy. jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm at
30 degrees. lung examination is remarkable for a few rales at the
left base , decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullness
to percussion. cardiac examination , regular rate and rhythm with
normal si , sii , positive siii. abdomen is soft and non-tender ,
slightly distended. she has pitting edema almost to the knees
bilaterally. neurological examination is non focal.
laboratory data: sma-7 is notable for a potassium of 5.4 and
creatinine of 1.2 with a bun of 20. cbc
demonstrated a white count of 14 , hematocrit of 42.9 , platelets
289 , digoxin level was 1.2. chest x-ray showed a left pleural
effusion which is unchanged , a new right pleural effusion +-
consolidation. ekg showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,
normal intervals , low voltage with poor r wave progression , no
significant change compared with 7/24/94.
hospital course: the patient was admitted with a picture of chronic
productive cough , progressive dyspnea with low
grade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition to
new opacity on chest x-ray. this clinical picture was felt to be
mostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on
underlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive
infection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. the
patient was started on empiric course of antibiotics including
cefotaxime and clarithromycin. she was seen in consultation by the
pulmonary service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressive
diuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive intervention
such as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. the patient was thus
treated with aggressive iv diuresis with excellent symptomatic
result. as her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt that
a chest ct would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe for
possible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. she thus
underwent a chest ct on 2/6/94 with demonstration of a large
peripheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of a
right lower lobe pulmonary infarction. no endobronchial lesions or
lymphadenopathy were noted. given the patient's history of dilated
cardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the
chest ct findings with the chest radiologist and pulmonary consult
team , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically
for a pulmonary embolus. she was thus started on iv heparin with
achievement of therapeutic ptt prior to switching to oral coumadin
without complications. in addition the patient underwent lower
extremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venous
thrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed no
evidence of rv strain or right ventricular thrombus. of note , this
echocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventricle
with severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejection
fraction of 15-20%. though the possibility that the wedge shaped
opacification seen on ct was due to pneumonia rather than
infarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejection
fraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,
and thus pulmonary angiogram or vq scan would not be likely to
alter management. the patient was discharged to home.

100 iv tid x 4 days with excellent response and then switched to her
home diuretic regiment of 100 mg bid of po torsemide and 5 mg po
zaroxolyn on the day prior to discharge still with good diuretic
effect. her admission wt was 132.9kg and on day of discharge she
weighed 125.8kg: net total loss of 7.1 kg or 15.6 lbs per this admit.
during this admission , strict i/o's , daily weight. fluid

platlets that was initially concerning , but ultimately appeared
to be lab variation with its resolution on the next blood
draw. renal:pt was admitted with acute

elevation gradually resolved from 2.4 on admission to 1.8 at time of
discharge. her celebrex was stopped 2/2 arf.
proph: pt was placed on
heparin 5000u sc bid for dvt prophylaxis and nexium

lft's were alt:368 , ast: 274 , ap:158 with nl bilit 0.5 and bilid
0.3. ddx included congestion vs infection vs medications. hepatitis
deemed unlikely but hep panel still pending at time of discharge.
since pt's lft's did not resolve with excellent diuresis , it was felt
that it was not likely due to congestion. most likely etiology was felt
to be reaction to drug. pt was taken off the following hepatotoxic
meds: tylenol , statin , percocet , allopurinol. she was continued on her
tamoxifen , although case reports of hepatotoxicity noted; other
consideration included the neurontin , but lft's began to normalize on
medication. pt is scheduled to follow-up with gi , dr. hornshaw 2
days following discharge. fen: pt's lytes were aggressively repleted;
she required significant k repletion each day and will be d/c'd on k.
she was maintained on a na and fluid restriction and placed on a
cardiac and diabetic diet. ( endo ): dm: pt was initially placed on riss
given concern for hypogylcemia and her home regiment was gradually
added to her inpatient regiment with elevated fs.
pt was stable at time of discharge , sx's much improved , and scheduled f
or follow-up with cardiologist and chf nurse on 8/28/03.
additional comments: 1 )please stop the following medications: tylenol , percocet , zocor ,
cozaar , celebrex , allopurinol , aspirin
2 )follow-up on your liver enzyme elevations and guiaic positive stools

brief history of present illness ( to ccu admission ):
the patient was admitted to imh on 5/25/06. he had been behaving unlike
himself and was having black tarry stools for two days. the patient was found
to
be guaiac positive. a head ct showed no new lesions but did show
multiple infarcts that were known to be old. on 10/18/06 , the
patient had an egd showing clot in the distal esophagus. this
clot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped.
around midnight on 8/19/06 , the patient became borderline
hypertension for an unclear reason. his hematocrit was
stable. the patient's ace inhibitor and beta-blocker
were held. also , the patient's lasix was
held. on 8/19/06 at around 4:00 a.m. , the patient was
reportedly having fitful sleeping and went to the bathroom. soon
afterwards , the nurse noticed that the patient was having more
ectopy on telemetry. soon after 4:30 a.m. , the patient was
either found unresponsive or ventricular fibrillation was seen on
telemetry and a code was called. the rhythm was shown to be

hospital course by problem:
this is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease and
mitral valve replacement. he was initially admitted for an upper
gi bleed and was then admitted to the ccu status post v-fib arrest
and found to have nstemi. his course in the ccu was as follows:
1. cardiovascular:
a. ischemia: nstemi. the patient had a troponin elevation
beginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the nstemi
occurred
and then caused v-fib arrest. the peak troponin was 111.
cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,
and occlusion of the svg graft. two drug-eluting stents were placed
in the left circumflex. the patient was treated with aspirin ,
plavix , beta-blocker , and ace. the patient's beta-blocker and
ace doses were titrated during his hospital stay. the patient
was also taken off of lipitor briefly due to concern about his
liver function. at discharge , he is being restarted on his
outpatient doses of lipitor as well as a fibrate.
b. pump: the patient had congestive heart failure causing
pulmonary edema. by echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30%
with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe global
hypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. the patient
diuresed well during his ccu stay and on the floor. his i's and
o's were followed. he was net negative , and he was discharged
at a weight of 87 kilos. the patient had an echo to evaluate
for dyssynchrony. this echo did not find significant evidence of
dyssynchrony.
c. rhythm: the patient had a v-fib arrest and returned to
normal sinus rhythm. he received an amiodarone load as well as
amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. after he stabilized , the amiodarone was
discontinued after aicd implantation on on 7/1/06. the implantation itself
was uncomplicated though the patient developed hives thought to be due to
administration of prophylactic ancef. the patient was switched
to vancomycin for prophylaxis , followed by po clindamycin. his allergic
symptoms
resolved with one dose of iv benadryl.
2. gi: the patient came in with an upper gi bleed. a bleeding
vessel at the ge junction was clipped. the patient had a
transient lft elevation consistent with shock liver. lfts were
followed and declined appropriately during his hospitalization
and normalized before discharge. the patient was also maintained
on a proton pump inhibitor during his stay.
3. hematocrit: the patient was transfused two units of red blood
cells on 4/12/06 and 9/28/06. his hematocrit remained stable therafter. the
patient was taking lovenox as an
outpatient for protection of his mechanical mitral valve. during
the peri-procedure period for his icd implantation , the patient
was switched to heparin drip and was maintained on the heparin
drip for four days after device implantation. at that time , he
was restarted on his outpatient regimen of lovenox 70 mg b.i.d.
4. neuro: the patient has a history of cva with a residual left
hemiparesis. these symptoms were stable. the patient was also
seen by the psychiatry service to evaluate his memory deficits
and abilities to make decisions. the psychiatry team recommended
that the patient be followed by neurology after discharge and
that the patient be considered for a formal neuropsychiatric
testing for evaluation of his neurologic and cognitive deficits.
5. pulmonary: the patient's pulmonary edema resolved with
diuresis.
6. id: the patient presented with fever and an elevated white
blood cell count initially and a question of an infiltrate on chest
x-ray. this patient was covered with levofloxacin and flagyl for
three days empirically for aspiration pneumonia. during
hospitalization , he did have very transient low-grade
temperatures on two other occasions. cultures including chest
x-ray , urine and blood cultures were negative. the patient was afebrile prior
to discharge. as of the day of
this dictation , c. difficile tests were also negative.
7. renal: the patient's creatinine was elevated reaching a peak
of 1.9 on 4/12/06 in the setting of his cardiac arrest. the
patient's creatinine normalized and on the day prior to discharge
was 1.2.
8. nutrition: the patient was evaluated by speech and swallow.
initially , he was put on a puree-thin diet that was advanced to
mechanical soft and thin liquids prior to discharge.
9. endocrine: the patient is diabetic and was maintained on nph
22 units b.i.d. and a sliding scale. at the time of discharge ,
the patient's blood sugars were well controlled. he is being
discharged on lantus 48 units at bedtime ( a light increase over his outpatinet
dose ) as well as a novolog sliding scale for coverage during meals.
physical examination at discharge:
on the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile. heart rate
70-80s , blood pressure 90-120/66-70. oxygen saturation 96-98% on
room air. weight 87 kilograms. pertinent labs include a

discharge diagnosis: coronary artery disease.
history of present illness: mr. lina is a 72 year old man who
is status post a coronary artery
bypass graft and mitral valve replacement who presents with
recurrent unstable angina. he was admitted to the cardiology
service for cardiac catheterization. his history began in l976
when he presented with substernal chest pain and shortness of
breath. in l98l , he experienced an anterior myocardial infarction
and in october of l98l , underwent a three-vessel coronary artery
bypass graft with mitral valve replacement. he did fairly well
with no recurrent symptoms until september of l989 when he presented
with congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardial
infarction. a thallium exercise treadmill test revealed
inferoapical ischemia and the patient was continued with medical
therapy. he did well until one to two weeks prior to admission
when he developed chest pain which radiated to the left arm and was
persistent for three hours after which time it was treated with
nitroglycerin at re lalakety wood,rank hospital and resolved. an exercise
treadmill test was stopped secondary to shortness of breath and
thallium scan revealed inferoapical scarring and septal apical
reperfusion abnormality. the patient subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization at dentan lascrople which
revealed l00% occlusion of his left anterior descending graft and
patent posterior descending artry graft and om2 graft. his native
vessels were remarkable for significant disease throughout his left
anterior descending , an l00% circumflex lesion at the obtuse
marginal l , l00% proximal obtuse marginal lesion , and l00% right
coronary artery occlusion. left ventriculogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 0.6 with apical hypokinesis. the patient was
referred to cardiac surgery service for evaluation and coronary
artery bypass grafting was elected. past medical history:
remarkable for diet controlled diabetes mellitus , history of an
asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm , and a hiatal hernia.
current medications: inderal , procardia , aspirin , lasix , pepcid ,
maalox , nitrol paste , and intravenous heparin. allergies: no
known drug allergies. social history: the patient has a
longstanding cigarette smoking history which was stopped in l98l.
past surgical history: as above.
physical examination: he was a pleasant moderately obese male in
no acute distress. head/neck: within
normal limits. chest: clear bilaterally. cardiac: regular rate
and rhythm. abdomen: benign. extremities: without cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema with good peripheral pulses.
laboratory examination: electrocardiogram revealed sinus
bradycardia with first degree av block and
right bundle-branch block.
hospital course: on july , patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting and a left internal mammary
artery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery.
the patient tolerated the procedure well. post-operatively , the
patient developed intermittent rhythm disturbances with several
episodes of ventricular ectopy and bradycardia which were not felt
to be significant enough to warrant further investigation by the
cardiology service. the patient developed a blood culture that was
positive for enterobacter and the patient subsequently underwent
placement of a hickman catheter to receive a four week dose of
gentamicin and ceftriaxone. this was well tolerated without
complication.
disposition: condition on discharge: good. the patient is
discharged home and will receive a full course of
four weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. discharge
medications: coumadin , lopressor , and pepcid.

had angina in april 1992 and underwent coronary angiography in
october 1993 which revealed an 80% rca lesion , 70% om , 70% mid-lad ,
and 50% d1. the lv-gram was normal. she had a ptca to the rca
lesion with a 30% residual. she had recurrent exertional angina
one month later and a repeat catheterization at that time showed no
change. in february 1993 , she had several episodes of lightheadedness
and syncope which was felt to be secondary to sick sinus
syndrome. a ddd pacemaker was placed. she later had recurrent
chest pain at rest and again went to cardiac catheterization which
showed a 70% mid lad lesion , 30% rca , and a normal lv-gram with 75%
ejection fraction. she underwent ptca to the mid-lad lesion with a
20% residual. she was then discharged on lopressor , procardia , and
aspirin. in february 1993 , she underwent an ett , and exercised
4 minutes and 35 seconds on a standard bruce stopping due to
shortness of breath and fatigue. no ischemic changes were noted.
she has done well until two days prior to admission when she
experienced recurrent angina at rest , and was admitted to
tionwell swellmo hospital where she ruled out for a
myocardial infarction. she was discharged one day prior to

hospital course: this is a 72-year-old female with a history of
diverticulitis who presented with crampy
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting times several days. ct on
admission noted a diverticular abscess. ct was unable to drain it
due to its limited size. however , the patient continued to have
crampy abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting. the patient was taken
to the or on 10/19/01 for an exploratory laparotomy , sigmoid
colectomy and colostomy. the patient tolerated the procedure well
and was maintained npo , with an epidural for pain control , until
return of bowel function as witnessed by the gas and feces in the
colostomy bag.
by the time of discharge , the patient was ambulating with a wheeled
walker. she was tolerating a regular diet , had good pain control
on 2-4 mg q.4h. of dilaudid. of note , the patient has a
significant history of coronary artery disease , had a rule out mi
postoperatively with initial evidence of cardiac injury. however ,
the patient did complain of some atypical chest pain on
postoperative day #3. a repeat rule out mi illustrated a troponin
leak likely secondary to increased cardiac demands postoperatively.
the patient was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. in order to
control rates with a good effect. the patient was also continued
on a course of iv antibiotics , ampicillin , ceftazidime , flagyl and
diflucan. drainage from that particular abscess eventually
revealed enterococci , yeast and pseudomonas responsive to these
antibiotics.

history of present illness: this is a 63-year-old male presenting
with unstable angina. his first presentation with coronary disease
was in 1986 , when he ruled in for mi and a cath revealed 100%
occlusion of the circumflex , 99% d1 , and a subsequent angioplasty
of the circ to a 70% residual. he had an exercise treadmill two
months later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosis
of the circ and a 60% lad lesion , and a 90% d1. in october of
1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. cath
revealed 70% occlusion of the rca , 70-80% lad , and diffuse disease
in the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. he had diffuse
global hypokinesis and an ef of 40-50%. his angina progressed and
in 1994 he underwent a four vessel cabg , svg to the pda and om-1 ,
and a lima to the lad and d2. he did well until 1997 , when he
presented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddle
pulmonary embolism. he had a negative hypercoagulative workup
after this. in the recent years he has had a number of episodes of
epigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but no
additional myocardial infarctions. his most recent cath in july
of 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% lad , and subtotal
occlusion distally , a 60% mid-rca lesion , and patent svg to the pda
and the om , as well as the lima to the lad. in recent months the
patient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provoked
by walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. most often
the pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. he denies
associated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of the
pain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. the patient denies
orthopnea , pnd , or lower extremity edema. he has never had pain at
rest. on february the patient underwent an exercise treadmill
test walking five minutes on the standard bruce protocol , reaching
a heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. he had chest
pain as well as 1 mm st depressions. since then his angina has
occurred with less and less exertion until the morning of
admission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chest
tightness. he again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , or
radiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. the
pain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advised
by his cardiologist , dr. raymond merrihew , to come to the emergent
department. in the emergent department he was pain free and
received aspirin and was started on heparin. ekg showed no acute
changes. ck was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.

initial laboratories: sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 ,
bicarb 24 , bun 15 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose
253 , white count 5.3 , hematocrit 36.8 , platelets 144 , calcium 9.5 ,
mag 1.7 , ck 47 , troponin slightly elevated at 0.23 , inr 1.1. ekg
reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 , with normal axis and inferiorly
flattened t waves , with t in 1 , l in 6.
hospital course: 1. cardiovascularly , the patient was continued
on heparin and ruled out for mi by cks. on 10/21
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximal
lad , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal rca , and 80% proximal right
pda. his lima to the d2 and the lad were patent , as was the svg to
om-1. the svg to the rca was 100% occluded. a stent was placed in
the native mid-rca and angioplasty was undertaken of the right pda.
after the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he was
transitioned to lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for dvt prophylaxis. an
echo was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle with
moderate reduction in function and ef of 35%. there is thinning
and hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,
as well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. the rv
was normal. pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrial
pressure. the patient continues to have episodes of epigastric
discomfort and belching , and his ekg revealed only nonspecific t
wave changes. he was scheduled to undergo a submax exercise
treadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in his
troponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was having
some mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small pda that
had been angioplastied during cath. recath was thought to be low
yield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with the
interventional cardiology service. his medical regimen was
maximized and included a beta blocker , ace inhibitor , and nitrates.
his cardiac enzymes trended down to a ck of 32 and a troponin of
0.33 upon discharge. he underwent submaximum ett on 3/10 and
walked for nine minutes without ekg changes , but did experience
6/10 chest pain and some belching. the test was considered
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. of note , he
reached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80
during this submaximum stress test. the patient will be discharged
to home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , dr. devin peachey he will also have a follow-up stress test. he will see his
primary care physician , dr. panciera , for monitoring of his other
medical issues , including his diabetes. discharge condition is
stable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and discharge
medications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 10 mg

discharge date: 10/18/2004
attending: wally tylwalk m.d.
chief complaint:
nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea.
history of present illness:
this 81-year-old female with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and
atrial fibrillation presents with nausea , vomiting , left lower
quadrant pain for one day and chronic nonbloody diarrhea on
6/23/04. the patient has had diarrhea for years , but this
episode was more severe and it was accompanied by nausea and
vomiting. upon evaluation , she was found to have heme negative
stool. an abdominal ct showed a focal segment of colitis at the
splenic flexure with significant atheromatous disease of the sma.
findings were worrisome for mesenteric ischemia. as part of her
preoperative evaluation , she underwent a stress mibi which showed
anterolateral , apical , and inferoposterior ischemia consistent with
three-vessel disease or left main disease. she does report
intermittent chest pressure and shortness of breath at rest and
with mild exertion over the past few years , increasing in the last three
months. she also reports two-pillow orthopnea and pmd. given
these findings , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
6/11/04 as well as evaluation for celiac , sma and ima.
catheterization showed 40% left main lesion. otherwise , patent
coronary artery.
past medical history:
includes diabetes with a hemoglobin a1c of 5.7 in 9/15 ,
hypertension , question of copd , depression , coronary artery
disease with an echo showing an ef of 45% on baseline inferior
hypokinesis.
medications:
lasix , atenolol , bupropion , fosamax , metformin , and lisinopril.
she has no known drug allergies.
on physical exam , the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of
72 , blood pressure of 132/61 , respiratory rate 20 , with an o2
saturation of 93% on room air. cardiovascular exam was
remarkable for a regular heart rate with a normal s1 and s2.
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. abdominal exam was
remarkable for quiet by all sounds. no tenderness and no
distention. extremities had no edema , 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.
abdominal angiography showed patent celiac sma and ima.
there was enhanced vascularity in the definitive or sliding
flexure but no embolic or angiographic cut off. the patient was
treated with ng tube to suction which improved his symptoms
although she cotinued to have.
lab data: remarkable for negative cardiac enzymes x3. calcium
and magnesium , and potassium were repleted as needed. ekg was
unchanged with normal sinus rhythm with occasional pvcs.
remainder of hospital course:
1. cardiovascular: the patient was started on mild lasix diuresis for
shortness of breath with slight improvement in symptoms.
echocardiogram showed an ejection fracture of 50% with thick
aortic valve , thick mitral valve with trace mr , trace tr and
hypokinesis. there is severe baseline anteroseptal
distal-lateral apical hypokinesis and base posterior wall is
mildly hyperkinetic. compared to report from 7/17 , lv
function appeared slightly worse. she was continued on aspirin ,
ace inhibitor , beta-blocker , statin. she was mainly in normal
sinus rhythm but due to recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular rate , she remained under rate control with
beta-blockers.
2. gi: the patient was n.p.o. with an ng tube to suction for the
first several days of her admission with resolution of nausea and
vomiting with continued diarrhea. her diet was advanced to
clears and then a low-residue diet , which she tolerated
well. her workup for chronic diarrhea included c. diff. , stool
cultures , fecal leukocytes , fecal fat , tsh , esr , ana , which were
all negative. celiac sprue serologies were also sent and were
pending upon discharge. at this point , gi was consulted and the
patient underwent a colonoscopy and egd. colonoscopy showed
diverticula in the rectus sigmoid. there is overlying erythema
over the splenic flexure with shallow erosions suggestive of
ischemic colitis. random biopsies were taken to rule out
microscopic colitis. egd was unremarkable. biopsies were
obtained and are pending to rule out h. pylori. colonoscopy and
egd biopsies should be followed up as an outpatient. likely
etiology secondary to microscopic ischemia secondary to
malabsorption of celiac sprue.
:3. infectious diseases: she completed a six-day course of
ampicillin , levofloxacin , and flagyl. on 6/11/04 , the patient
remained c. diff negative during the hospitalization.
4. pulmonary: shortness of breath likely secondary to pulmonary
process or underlying pulmonary disease in light of normal heart
function which should be followed up as an outpatient.
5. endocrine: metformin was held during the hospitalization
secondary to contrast administration. she remained on a regular
insulin sliding scale with adequate blood sugar control.
6. renal: the patient was hydrated , pre and post di-loads with
unremarkable course of renal function.
7. prophylaxis: the patient was maintained on subcu heparin and
pepcid.
the patient was stable , tolerating p.o. intake and p.o. meds.
she was discharged to rehab and will follow up with her primary
care physician and with cardiology and gi.

( cap , atypicals , tb , pcp , fungal ). patient's shortness of breath responded
to diuresis , and his symptoms improved. however bronchoscopy revealed
rml fresh blood , and ct chest is concerning for rml mass. will need
follow up with pulmonary which is already arranged.
1. ) cv: no evidence of ischemia. patient continued outpatient asa ,
bblocker , statin , plavix. h/o cardiac transplant. cyclosporine level on
10/27 was 152. his cyclosporine was increased during admission to 100mg po
bid. his sirolimus was discontinued.
pump- he was intially volume overloaded on exam. bnp on admission was 674.
he was diuresed with lasix 40mg po bid , and will be discharged on lasix
40mg po daily. also given potassium 10meq a day , will need lytes
followed. his hctz was discontinued. weight on day of discharge was
62.2kg. bp control with home regimen of dilt , lopressor , cadura.
2. ) pulm: pulmonary was consulted. ct was negative for pe. he had a
bronchoscopy which was described above ( fresh blood oozing from rml ). bal
was sent for multiple studies. pcp was negative , influenza negative , adeno
negative , viral studies , cultures , and cytology are pending at this time.
galact ag was negative. gbm antibody was negative. anca is pending.
bronchoscopy and chest ct were concerning for rml mass. he will follow up
with a pet ct and pulmonary appointment on 9/2/07. allergy was consulted
re whether his symptoms could be an allergic pneumonitis ( given history of
asa allergy , an previous desensitization , and they felt it was unlikely.
rheumatology was consulted re possible vasculitis given new proteinuria -
thought unlikely although final consult recommendations were pending at
time of discharge. he will be discharged on oxygen given desat to 87% on
ra with ambulation. he will be treated empirically with levofloxacin x 14

additional comments: you were admitted to osweneer and hospital with shortness of
breath. you were diuresed with furosemide ( lasix ) and your shortness of
breath has improved. you have continued to need oxygen when you walk or
exert yourself , and you will be discharged with oxygen which you should
use whenever you walk or exert yourself.
you had a bronchoscopy during this hospital admission which revealed some
blood in your right middle lung. you will need follow up with a
pulmologist regarding this finding. it is very important that you keep
your appointment for a follow up pet ct scan on 10/27 , and the appointment
the same day with the pulmonologist. you also have an appointment with
the heart transplant service here at otmc on 3/15 , and it is important
that you keep that appointment as well. please call your primary care
doctor and arrange to see him in the next week to follow up this
hospitalization.
there were several changes to your medication. these include:
1 ) stop your sirolimus ( rapamune )
2 ) increase cyclosporine to 100mg twice a day ( you had been taking 50mg
twice a day )
3 ) stop your hydrochlorothiazide
4 ) start furosemide ( lasix ) , a diuretic , 40mg once a day
5 ) start levofloxacin , an antibiotic , and take one pill every other day to
complete a fourteen day course , last day 6/2/07
6 ) start potassium chloride 10meq a day
7 ) continue your other medications
you will have visiting nurses come to the house to assist you with your
oxygen , medication checks and teaching , and a home safety evaluation.
they should also check your electrolytes twice a week , and specifically
monitor your creatinine , potassium , and magnesium with reports to your
pcp who can adjust your medications.
please seek medical attention if you again develop any shortness of
breath , coughing up blood , chest pain , lightheadedness or fainting , or
any other concerning symptoms.
discharge condition: stable
to do/plan:
1 ) follow cyclosporine levels , sirolimus was discontinued during this
hospital admission.
2 ) follow up rheumatoid factor levels , hepatitis serologies , anca , ch50 ,
iron deficiency anemia , proteinuria , bal viral studies , bal cultures
3 ) follow up bal cytology
4 ) follow up the lung mass seen on ct scan and blood oozing on
bronchoscopy from rml. patient has a pet ct scheduled for 10/27 , and
follow up in pulmonary clinic 10/27
5 ) complete empiric levofloxacin course 14 days , last day 6/2/07

history of present illness: mr. quigg is a 42-year-old man with
history of diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
left charcot foot complicated by recurrent cellulitis , who
presented with left lower leg swelling , erythema , and pain. the
patient does not recall having fevers at home , however , notes
that he ""get fevers all the time"" so he feels that he may not
have noticed. he did report that he had a temperature to about
101 and hemodialysis prior to admission for which he received one
dose of vancomycin. he denied having any symptoms of headache ,
chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , joint aches or
rash. he did endorse feeling fatigued with little energy. the
patient was referred to the emergency department given his
temperature of 101 at hemodialysis.
the patient has a long history of pain in his left foot secondary
to charcot joint and chronic recurrent cellulitis including a
history of mrsa cellulitis. he has had numerous admissions to
smc in the past year for treatment of the foot for which he
received several courses of antibiotics. he was treated from
10/5 through 10/24 with antibiotics posthemodialysis. at
the end of 10/24 , after returning from weekend away he had
severe exacerbation of the pain in his left foot with progressive
development of swelling on the bottom of his foot. at this time ,
he had extensive evaluation including an mri of the foot and it
was felt that there was no evidence of osteomyelitis. his
antibiotics were discontinued at this time and he was discharged
to a nursing home for rehabilitation. he remained in the nursing
home from 1/18 through 5/22 and was discharged home two
weeks prior to admission.

hospital course by system:
1 ) id-given his presentation of l lower leg swelling and
erythema , mr. bock was started on vancomycin and unasyn in the
emergency department. an x-ray of his l foot revealed significant
fragmentation and erosion of the tarsal/metatarsal bases and
focal soft tissue abnormality in the plantar region concerning
for abscess formation and possible osteomyelitis in the setting
of known charcot arthropathy as well as diffuse soft tissue
swelling extending along the calf. given these findings , he was
ordered for an mri. with his mri pending and his l leg looking
somewhat improved , his unasyn was discontinued on hd 3 and he was
started on augmentin and his vancomycin was continued given his
history of mrsa cellulitis in the past. he spiked a fever on hd 3
and again on hd 4. on hd 5 , he had an mri under conscious
sedation ( was attempted prior to this , but pt unable to
tolerate ). mri revealed 4 cm fluid pocket in the subcutaneous
tissue of the plantar aspect of the left foot demonstrating
communication with the medial tendon sheaths and the ankle joint
with findings worrisome for abscess and osteomyelitis of at least
the medial malleolus , calcaneus , cuboid and talus. infectious
disease was consulted and he was started on iv levofloxacin and
iv flagyl to cover gram negatives and anaerobes respectively and
his vancomycin continued to be dosed for level less than 20.
orthopedics was consulted who performed an arthrocentesis of his
ankle as well as an arthrocentesis of the fluid collection at the
bottom of his foot. ankle aspirate gram stain was negative , but
with 4+ polys. fluid differential revealed >160 , 000 wbcs. in
consultation with infectious disease , orthopedics , and the
patient , it was decided that the best course of action would be a
l below knee amputation given the extent of the infection. this
was performed on hd 8 by dr. miears he did have fever spikes
again on hd 8-9 and had repeat blood cultures which were
negative. an echocardiogram was performed on hd 12. while he did
have a tiny focal thickening of the aortic cusp , this was
reviewed with cardiology and infectious disease and was not
though to represent a vegetation. he was afebrile x >48 hours
prior to discharge. his surgical pathology returned with clean
margins on day of discharge , and as per id consult service , he
does not need further antibiotics. he should have dry sterile
dressing changes to his residual limb daily. he may need an extra
dose of pain medication prior to this. if there is any evidence
of erythema or drainage , dr. fuller 's office should be
contacted at 365-299-5817.
2 ) renal-mr. merriweather was on the renal service and had hemodialysis
3 times a week ( m/w/f ) without complication. of note , he is
awaiting kidney transplant from his sister and is followed by dr.
felix zelle at nnh .
3 ) heme-mr vaeth was on coumadin as an outpatient. we obtained
his hospital records from nuom and a vascular study from 9/19
showed evidence of a dvt in the l internal jugular vein from
5/5 the details surrounding this dvt are not documented ,
however mr. tirona reports that his vascular surgeon told him
that he should remain on coumadin. his coumadin was held prior to
going to the or and he was placed on a heparin drip. his coumadin
was restarted after his bka and he was bridged with heparin with
a goal ptt of 60-80. prior to discharge , he ptt was 103 and his
heparin drip was decreased from 2100 to 1950units per hours. he
should have a repeat ptt checked on transfer to his acute
rehabilitation center with goal ptt 60-80. inr on day of
discharge was 1.8 , 1.6 day prior to discharge. his heparin drip
can be discontinued once his inr is therapeutic with goal of 2-3.
his inr will need to be followed every 2-3 days until stable off
of levofloxacin.
4 ) cv
ischemia-mr grana was on gemfibrozil 600mg bid and lipitor 80mg
as an outpatient. his lipid panel was checked: tc 140 , tg 151 ,
ldl 82 , hdl 28. given that his ldl was 82 and the risk of
rhabdomylosis on high dose gemfibrozil and lipitor , his lipitor
was decreased to 20mg. he should have a repeat lipid panel in 4-6
weeks. he was also started on low dose b-blocker to reduce
perioperative mi risk prior to his surgery. he reported that he
is not on aspirin given that he has had b/l vitrectomies and his
doctor felt that the risk of bleeding was too high. this can be
readdressed as an outpatient.
pump-pt had elevated systolic blood pressures to the 160s in the
beginning of his stay. he was started on lisinopril which was
uptitrated to 5mg and also lopressor.
rhtyhm-he had no evidence of arrythmias.
5 ) endocrine-mr. rovella has dm which was diagnosed at age 23. it
is unclear if he has type i or ii as he reported that he was told
he has type i , but had a three year stint after diagnosis where
he was not on insulin. his fs on admission were elevated , likely
secondary to his infection and his lantus was uptitrated. he was
also started on prandial coverage. prior to discharge , he was his
home dose of lantus as well as aspart with meals. he reported
that he already has an outpatient endocrinologist with whom he
will follow up. an hga1c was 8.4.
6 ) pain-mr. vanhee had significant post operative pain which
seemed to be mostly phantom limb pain. the acute pain service was
consulted and he was initially placed on a ketamine drip and
fentanyl pca. his fentanyl pca and ketamine drip were
discontinued and he was started on oxycontin 80mg tid with
oxycodone for breakthrough pain. he was also started on lyrica
for neuropathic pain. he was comfortable prior to discharge on
this current regimen. as his pain improves , he pain regimen
should be decreased.
7 ) psychiatry-after learning that he would likely receive a
transplant from his sister , mr. potvin reports that he has had
significant anxiety prior to going for dialysis. psychiatry
service was consulted who recommended low dose ativan prior to
him going to dialysis.

principal diagnosis: 1. atrial flutter. 2. congestive heart
failure.
history of present illness: the patient is a 67-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure
and history of atrial flutter in september of 1998. the patient was
admitted to cardiology for treatment of atrial flutter and
worsening congestive heart failure. the patient initially
presented to aler hospital in september of 1998 with
acute shortness of breath and atrial flutter. chest x-ray at that
time showed congestive heart failure. the patient was initially
rate controlled with verapamil and digoxin and converted to normal
sinus rhythm. however , on digoxin , the patient developed
junctional tachycardia , which reverted back to normal sinus rhythm
after digoxin was discontinued. echocardiogram at that time showed
an ejection fraction of 35%. the patient was discharged on 11 of may
in normal sinus rhythm. the patient was discharged on lopressor ,
verapamil , aspirin , and coumadin , which was stopped five months
ago. the patient did extremely well after discharge until about
five days ago when he ran out of his atenolol , which he had not
taken since then. over the past week , the patient had extreme
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion , which steadily worsened. today ,
the patient was taking out the trash and experienced a few seconds
of chest heaviness on the left side , without any radiation. the
patient reported being short of breath , but had no other symptoms.
upon trying to the mailbox , the patient was extremely short of
breath and fell to the ground , but had no loss of consciousness.
there was no warning or dizziness. the patient was brought to
tien medical center emergency department. there , the patient was
noted to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150. the patient was
given iv lopressor , 5 mg , and his heart rate came down to 106.
review of systems: a review of systems was positive for three
pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and increasing
lower extremity swelling over the past week. the patient denied
any fever , chills , night sweats , or change in bowel movements.
past medical history: past medical history was significant for
high blood pressure , left ankle and left knee arthritis ,
questionable history of gout , gonococcal urethritis ,
diverticulosis , elevated cholesterol , and cardiomyopathy with
ejection fraction of 35% by echocardiogram in september of 1998.
allergies: the patient has no known drug allergies. medications
on admission: at the time of admission , the patient was on
simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day ,
atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , which the patient self discontinued
five days prior to admission , lisinopril 20 mg q. day , aspirin ,
b12 , folate , and multivitamins. social history: the patient's
social history was significant for tobacco , one pack per day for
forty years. the patient quit in february of 1998. alcohol was
significant for two to three drinks per day , with none since
september of 1998. there was no history of drug use. the patient
lives in derdflintvo alone. the patient is a retired social worker.
family history: the patient's family history was significant for a
mother with a myocardial infarction at 60 , brother with myocardial
infarction at 54 , and father who is deceased from cerebrovascular
accident.
physical examination: on physical examination , the patient was
afebrile. the heart rate was 115 , blood
pressure 150/100 , and saturation 95% on 2 liters. in general , the
patient was alert and oriented and in no acute distress. heent
revealed the patient to be normocephalic , atraumatic. the pupils
were equal , round and reactive to light. the extraocular movements
were intact. the oropharynx was moist. the neck was supple
without bruits. the chest was clear to auscultation.
cardiovascular examination revealed a 1/6 holosystolic murmur. the
patient was in atrial flutter. the abdominal examination was
benign. the extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. there was no
clubbing or cyanosis. electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial
flutter at rate of 50 , as well as left axis deviation , right bundle
branch block , left ventricular hypertrophy with qrs widening , old
inferior myocardial infarction , and right bundle branch block.
chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion ,
consistent with congestive heart failure , and bilateral pleural
effusions.
laboratory data: laboratory data on admission showed sodium 146 ,
potassium 4.4 , creatinine 1.2 , white blood cell
count 6.7 , hematocrit 42.5 , ck 95 , and troponin 0.05.
hospital course: the patient was admitted to the cardiology floor
for treatment of atrial flutter and congestive
heart failure. the patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. it was felt that the patient's worsening congestive
heart failure was likely secondary to his flutter. the patient was
started on lasix in addition to being started on a beta blocker.
however , the patient remained in atrial flutter with poor rate
control. echocardiogram on 7 of september showed an ejection fraction of
30-35% with global hypokinesis. of note , also , the patient's
ventricular myocardium showed an echo bright appearance consistent
with possible infiltrative disease. on 14 of october , the patient
underwent cardioversion without complications , as he was still in
atrial flutter and was not having good rate control. the patient
was successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm
afterwards. however , on 23 of may , the patient was still significantly
short of breath and hypoxic. this was felt probably likely
secondary to fluid overload , and the patient was started on lasix.
however , the patient underwent a vq scan and was ruled out for
pulmonary embolism. the patient did well and , on 6 of april , the patient
experienced bilateral lip swelling , consistent with angioedema.
the patient's lasix and captopril were discontinued , as it was
unclear which agent had caused this , however , it was most likely
the captopril. this responded well to benadryl. the patient was
started on ethacrynic acid and hydralazine for diuresis and
afterload reduction. the patient did well on this regimen. on
26 of february , the patient was discharged home in stable condition. the
patient was in sinus rhythm and was satting well on room air.
medications on discharge: at the time of discharge , the patient
was on albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg
inhaled q. 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing , enteric coated aspirin
325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , edecrin 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q. day , hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day , and
benadryl 50 mg p.o. q. 6 hours as needed for lip swelling.
follow-up: the patient was instructed to follow-up with dr. kotow
in one week. disposition: the patient was discharged to home with
services , to be followed by aflintsa mo hendco vna for blood pressure and
weight checks q.o.d.

discharge date:
attending: rosario frederic cypress md
service: cardiac surgery.
history of present illness: the patient is a 66-year-old male
who was being worked up for other surgery and during preoperative
testing he was noted to have an abnormal ekg. this prompted a
cardiac stress test , which was abnormal. he therefore received
additional cardiac workup and was found to have coronary artery
disease. he does have a history of atrial fibrillation in the
past , but reports that he has not had any symptoms prior to his
initially planned shoulder surgery. he therefore presented for
cabg rather than having shoulder surgery.
past medical history:
1. hypertension.
2. diabetes.
3. hyperlipidemia.
4. copd.
5. bph.
6. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. nephrolithiasis.
8. impotence.
9. bursitis.
10. non-allergic rhinitis.
11. history of hepatitis in 1960.
12. constipation.
13. right-sided renal artery stenosis.
14. renal insufficiency.
past surgical history:
1. left rotator cuff repair in 1991.
2. tonsillectomy.
3. thumb surgery in childhood.
family history: no history of coronary artery disease.
social history: the patient has a history of smoking. he also
drinks approximately 2 beers per month.
allergies: procainamide , which causes diarrhea and arthralgia ,
also verapamil , which can cause constipation.
medications upon admission:
1. toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. propafenone 150 mg p.o. q.d.
4. aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

6. simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7. metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
8. glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
physical examination: upon admission , height 5 feet 10 inches ,
weight 102 kg , heart rate of 54 , blood pressure 130/88 in the
right arm and 142/88 in the left arm. heent: pupils equal ,
round , and reactive to light. extraocular movements are intact.
mucous membranes are moist. oropharynx is clear. there are no
carotid bruits. dentition is without evidence of infection.
chest is free of incisions. cardiovascular: regular rate and
rhythm. there are no murmurs. pulses: carotid , radial ,
femoral , dorsalis pedis , and posterior tibialis pulses are all 2+
bilaterally. allen's test in the left upper extremity was normal
with using a pulse oximeter. respiratory: the patient has clear
breath sounds bilaterally. abdomen: there are no incisions.
abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds. extremities: are free of scarring , varicosities
or edema. neurologic: the patient is alert and oriented. he
has no focal deficits.
labs upon admission: sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 105 ,
bicarbonate 28 , bun 18 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 178 , magnesium 2 ,
white count 8 , hematocrit 38.5 , hemoglobin 13.6 , platelets 163 ,
pt 16 , inr 1.3 , ptt 34.9. urinalysis is normal. cardiac
catheterization done on 8/28/04 revealed a 90% ostial lad
lesion , 70% ostial ramus , 90% mid d1 , 80% ostial d3 , 75% proximal
circumflex , 50% ostial rca , 90% proximal pda. there was right
dominant circulation and 75%-80% right renal artery stenosis. he
had an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.
hospital course: the patient was admitted to hospital on
4/25/04 and was taken to the operating room on 10/19/04 where he
received a five-vessel cabg in which the left internal mammary
artery was sewn to the lad. saphenous vein graft 1 to first
diagonal artery. right internal mammary artery was sewn to the
ramus. the left radial artery was harvested and sewn to lvb2 and
lvb1. bypass time was 159 minutes. cross clamp time 111
minutes. postoperatively , he was taken to the cardiac intensive
care unit where he was hemodynamically stable. he was rapidly
weaned of the ventilator without problems. he did develop a bout
of rapid atrial fibrillation in the first two days
postoperatively. this was treated by restarting the patient's
propafenone , which he was taken preoperatively for atrial
fibrillation. the patient's other primary issue postoperatively
while in the intensive care unit was an episode of oliguria , near
anuria. a renal consult was obtained at this time. he did
receive a bilateral renal ultrasound , which showed kidneys to be
essentially equal in size with no hydronephrosis. he was started
on low-dose dopamine and once his systolic pressure went back to
his baseline preoperative systolic pressure of approximately 160 ,
he began to make adequate amounts of urine. it was therefore
determined that his renal perfusion is largely pressure dependent
with him requiring a mean pressure of close to 100. he remained
hemodynamically stable. he did have some constipation , which was
treated with an aggressive bowel regimen and subsequently
resolved. he will be transferred out to the cardiac step-down
unit on 9/7/04.
the remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated at the
time of discharge.

discharge date: 8/16/1991
history of present illness: this is a 58-year-old oriental male
with three vessel coronary artery
disease awaiting surgical evaluation. the initial onset of angina
was in 1972. he had a positive ett with st depressions in v5 and
v6. he had only rare angina since then treated with sublingual
nitroglycerin or rest. on 5/16/91 , he had a positive ett which was
stopped secondary to chest pain. the ekg showed 2 mm st
depressions in two , three , f and v4 through v6. he was encouraged
to have a cardiac catheterization , but he was reluctant to do this.
he has good exercise tolerance; takes long walks with his wife
without chest pain and swims for an hour a day. he had a cardiac
catheterization on the day of admission which showed 70% left main ,
100% left circumflex , 100% rca and 90% lad. past history:
significant for gi bleed in the past. medications on admission:
atenolol; persantine.
physical examination: revealed a pleasant man in no acute
distress. the heent exam was benign. the
neck was supple and nontender. the lungs were clear. the heart
exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm. pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruits. the neuro exam was nonfocal.
assessment: 58-year-old oriental male with unimpressive symptoms
but strongly positive ett and severe three vessel coronary artery
disease including left main at catheterization.
hospital course: the patient was seen by cardiac surgery and
evaluated. he was taken to the operating room on
8/12/91. he had a coronary artery bypass graft times four with a
lima to the lad and saphenous vein grafts to the diagonal , marginal
and pda. postoperatively he did very well with the exception of
24-48 hours of severe confusion and agitation after extubation
requiring four point restraints and haldol. he gradually resolved
this by postop day #3 and began gently diuresing. his wound had
continuous oozing from the left thigh with no erythema or sign of

history of present illness: this is a 39-year-old white male with
multiple risk factors for coronary
artery disease , including sex , weight , hypertension , smoking ,
positive family history and cholesterol. he had a four month
history of exercise induced crescendo angina with palpitations and
had an exercise thallium study done on the day of admission. the
results of this showed questionable evidence of ischemia. he was
able to exercise for nine minutes and 16 seconds with a heart rate
of 160 and a blood pressure of 166/84. his test was stopped for
mild chest pain of 3/10 and fatigue. there was no ekg changes
except for some apcs , pvcs and upsloping st changes. a thallium
scan showed a fixed inferior defect and anterior redistribution on
a later scan; this was on a preliminary reading. the final reading
is pending at this time. after the study , he continued to have
waxing and waning episodes of chest pressure that were not
completely relieved with nitroglycerin. in the emergency room , he
was treated with metoprolol , sublingual nitroglycerin , heparin
drip and aspirin. allergies: none known.
physical examination: revealed a well appearing anxious man in no
apparent distress. the heent exam was
unremarkable. the neck was supple with a 0.5 cm nodule in the left
upper pole of the thyroid that is moveable and nontender. the
cardiovascular exam revealed no extra heart sounds or murmurs. the
lungs were clear. the abdomen was soft and nontender. the
extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema. he had good
distal pulses and no bruits in the femoral arteries post
catheterization. the wound was clean.
laboratory examination: cholesterol 285; serial cks 112 , 81 and
66; t-3 149; t-4 6.6; tsh 1.5.
hospital course: he continued to have chest pain during the
evening with normal ekgs unchanged from
admission. because of the continued nature of the pain , he was
placed on a nitroglycerin drip and given morphine sulfate which
controlled the pain. on the second hospital day he had a cardiac
catheterization of both sides of the heart which showed normal lv
function and normal coronaries per the cardiology note. he has
been free of chest pain since the procedure and has been taken off
of all of his medications.
disposition: he was discharged in good condition. medications on
discharge: tylenol 650 mg p.o. p.r.n. pain. follow
up will be with dr. lahaie , his cardiologist. dr. acuna has
been informed of the findings on cardiac catheterization , and the
patient has been instructed to call her after his meeting with the
cardiologist. he has also been advised to lose some weight and to
modify his diet in order to correct his hypercholesterolemia. dr.
yoo will follow up on the thyroid nodule and the high
cholesterol.
discharge diagnoses: 1. risk factors for coronary artery disease.
2. hypertension.
3. ten pack year smoking history ( inactive ).

complex medical history including a septic right knee arthritis
with mrsa complicated by a picc line-induced right upper extremity
dvt followed by bacteremia with multi-resistant klebsiella
pneumoniae , treated with meropenem for 14 days with the course
ending on 11/11/2006. the patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominal
pain during his last admission 2 weeks ago associated with low-volume mucus
diarrhea , c. diff toxin assay was at that time negative on 1/24
abdominal ct showed diverticulosis with stranding of the sigmoid colon.
blood cultures grew klebsiella , treated with 14 days of meropenem
as previously noted. however , since this discharge , the mild
abdominal pain persisted. he continues to have low-grade mucus
diarrhea about 5 times a day , not associated with fever , chills
or anorexia. over the last 2 days prior to this admission , the
diarrhea became high volume , still nonbloody and not associated
again with fever or chills. he was brought into the emergency
department at which time , he was afebrile with a blood pressure
of 85/49 , heart rate in the 80s , respiratory rate of 20 , o2
saturation 93% on room air. at that time , he received volume
resuscitation with 2 liters of iv fluids , stool samples for c.
diff assay were sent. he received empiric therapy with p.o.
vancomycin. an abdominal ct in the emergency department showed
thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum.
past medical history: includes coronary artery disease as noted
with an anterior mi in 2003 , that had complicated to vt arrest ,
status post cabg in 2003 that was a left internal mammary artery
to lad with saphenous vein graft to the pta and obtuse marginal.
he has had a catheterization in 3/12 that showed patent grafts
and drug-eluting stent to the left circumflex. he has chronic
kidney disease , baseline creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , c. diff colitis in 2003 , bph ,
asthma , gerd , status post right upper extremity picc-related dvt
and right knee septic arthritis.
medications: aspirin 81 mg , plavix 75 mg , coumadin 5 mg , digoxin 0.125 mg ,
lasix 49 mg daily , lisinopril 10 mg daily , lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , zocor 80 mg
daily , flomax 0.4 mg daily and flovent 110 mcg b.i.d.
allergies: penicillin which caused hives and swelling.
social history: he previously a smoker. he does not drink. he
is a nursing home resident.
family history: significant for coronary artery disease , two
brothers who had coronary artery disease in their 60s. no family
history of cancer.
physical examination: vitals as previous noted , blood pressure
in the 80s/49 , heart rate 80 , regular , respiratory rate 20 , o2
saturation 93% on room air. patient was afebrile. pertinent
physical findings included: pulmonary: he had a prolonged
expiratory phase , but no crackles. cardiovascular: distant heart
sounds , regular rate and rhythm. normal s1 and s2. no rubs or
gallops. systolic ejection or murmur 3/6 at the left lower
sternal border. abdomen: obese , distended abdomen , left lower
quadrant tenderness to palpation. no rebound at this time.
extremities are warm , 2+ pulses with 1+ bilateral lower extremity
edema to the shins. neurologic: alert and oriented x3 , cranial
nerves grossly intact , no abnormalities.
admission abdominal ct showed bowel wall thickening in
the descending sigmoid colon and rectum. chest x-ray showed
left-sided pleural effusion , atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
laboratory data: labs were significant for a white count of
15.7 , hematocrit of 35.5 and inr of 3.2. electrolytes were
normal.
patient was initially admitted to the micu for hypertension and
infectious etiology. he was stabilized there and transferred to
the floor within a few days.
hospital course:
1. colitis , presumed infectious etiology , descending and sigmoid
colon. colitis was worse over the last month , associated with
diarrhea. abdominal ct is consistent with an infectious
inflammatory bowel process. given history of c. diff colitis , c.
diff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others were
possible. ischemic colitis was considered secondary to low
forward flow , given patient's cardiomyopathy and low ejection
fraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatory
colitis or nonspecific colitis. stool samples were sent for a c.
diff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples.
stool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out during
admission. empiric treatment was started with p.o. vancomycin.
patient's abdominal pain continued to improve and completely
resolved. by discharge , patient remained afebrile and white
blood cell count decreased. advance patient's diet as tolerated
and by discharge the patient was up to soft solids. we added
lactobacillus p.o. for probiotics and patient also had flex sig
two days before discharge , showing resolving inflammation
consistent with colitis of inflammatory etiology. the flex sig
did not change his management. we did discharge the patient on a
2-week course p.o. vancomycin alone.
2. coronary artery disease. patient had no evidence for acute
coronary syndrome on admission. we continued his aspirin ,
plavix , statin and beta-blocker. patient had no ischemic issues
or coronary artery disease issues during his admission.
3. chf. patient has previous ef noted at 20% to 35% , so a
gentle hydration therapy at first in the micu for hypertension
and then as patient's blood pressure increased , was able to
restart patient's lasix dose in order to diurese all of the extra
fluid gained during the rehydration therapy , was restarted on the
lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , his daily dose at home. also considered
restarting lisinopril , but deferred discharge to outpatient
follow up with primary care physician for restart of lisinopril ,
once patient is fully recovered.
4. chronic kidney disease. patient had a baseline of creatinine
1.2 to 1.5 and he came into the hospital with a creatinine of 1.0.
the patient was below baseline and remained below baseline during
admission. he did not have any renal issues.
5. hematology. patient has a history a line-induced dvt , has
been treated with coumadin , with no definitive evidence as to how
along patient should be treated , given that the dvt was line
induced. coumadin was therapeutic on admission , became
supertherapeutic in the micu. held coumadin until inr fell below
3 , restarted coumadin afterwards at 6 mg p.o. daily , patient's
normal dose. patient was therapeutic on discharge. will follow
up with primary care physician for coumadin monitoring.
6. nutrition. patient was in the micu and was n.p.o. given
abdominal pain and colitis. when transferred to floor , was
started on liquid diet and advanced to soft solid diet. by
discharge , the patient did not have abdominal pain and most of
the diarrhea had resolved.
procedures performed: the patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopy
during the admission that showed colitis consistent with
inflammatory etiology.
diagnosis: patient had repeated negative c. diff toxin assays ,
but colitis was presumed to be c. diff and given history , could
have been other infectious or inflammatory etiologies. patient
continued to improve on vancomycin and thus was discharged with
presumed c. diff colitis diagnosis.
discharge medications: included aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , plavix
75 mg p.o. daily , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily , nexium 20 mg p.o.
daily , flovent 110 mcg inhale b.i.d. , lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,

adult-onset diabetes.
depression.
right knee arthroscopy.
status post myocardial infarction in 1994 and 1996.
history of present illness: the patient is a 66 year old male
status post coronary artery bypass
grafting and sternal wound infection , admitted with 3 days of
increasing shortness of breath. the patient has had severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately
20% , and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. he underwent
a 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein
grafts to the lvb , d1 and first obtuse marginal on 19 of october his
postoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound infection ,
with debridement performed on 15 of may he was put on vancomycin
and sent home 3 days prior to admission on intravenous vancomycin.
he felt okay , until 1 or 2 days prior to admission when he had
increased dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath. he also
complained of increasing orthopnea and a mild cough accompanied by
shaking chills the night prior to admission. he also complained of
mild upper and lower back pain. the patient denied dysuria. past
medical history is as noted above. the patient has no known drug
allergies. medications on admission were aspirin , 325 milligrams
each day , captopril , 25 milligrams 3 times a day , digoxin , 0.125
milligrams each day , lasix , 40 milligrams each day , colace , 100
milligrams twice a day , nph insulin , 35 units each morning , regular
insulin , 5 units each evening , metoprolol , 25 milligrams 3 times a
day , niferex , 150 milligrams twice a day , percocet as needed ,
vancomycin , 1.25 milligrams twice a day , axid , 150 milligrams twice
a day , and kcl , 40 milligrams each day. social history revealed
the patient lives with his wife , he is an exposed smoker and
occasional ethanol drinker. he is retired secondary to his
cardiomyopathy. he was able to ambulate and play golf prior to the
coronary artery bypass grafting in october .
physical examination: the patient was uncomfortable , tachypneic.
vital signs were temperature 100.7 , heart
rate 97 , blood pressure 108/67 , 96% oxygen saturation on 4 liters
by nasal cannula. head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination
showed extraocular movements were intact , pupils equal , round ,
reactive to light , oropharynx benign. neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy. chest showed left base bronchial breath sounds
with egophony , with a few scattered wheezes throughout.
cardiovascular examination showed jvp approximately 8 centimeters ,
carotids were i+ bilaterally , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm ,
s1 , s2 , very distant heart sounds. the liver edge was palpable.
abdomen was nontender , positive bowel sounds. skin showed the
upper chest wound where debridement had taken place , approximately
6 centimeters long at the incisional site , which was slightly
tender and erythematous. back showed no costovertebral angle
tenderness. extremities showed the patient had teds stockings on ,
there was trace edema , ii+ pulses bilaterally. neurologic
examination showed the patient was alert and oriented , fluent , and
the examination was nonfocal.
laboratory examination: on admission , sma-7 showed sodium 135 ,
potassium 5.1 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate
22 , bun 12 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 128. ck was 13 , triponin 0.0.
prothrombin time was 14.1 , partial thromboplastin time 27.5.
digoxin level was 0.6. complete blood count showed white blood
count 7.8 , differential 69 neutrophils , 16 lymphs , 7 monos , 8
eosinophils , hematocrit 28.7 , platelets 735 , 000. sputum from
27 of january showed 4+ hemophilus influenza , which was pan sensitive.
chest x-ray on the date of admission showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate with possible effusion. electrocardiogram showed left
bundle branch block. vq scan was low probability.
hospital course: 1. infectious disease. the patient had a
maximum temperature of 102.3 on 27 of february he was
on vancomycin , gentamicin and ceftazidime. on 13 of june , gentamicin
and ceftazidime were discontinued , and ofloxacin was started
secondary to decreasing creatinine. after his temperature spike on
21 of august , the patient's maximum temperature declined each of the
following days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. the
sternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued on
vancomycin for the coagulase negative staphylococcus that grew from
the wound site on 15 of may the patient had a computerized
tomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternal
wound site and no abscess was seen. thoracentesis was done on the
left pleural effusion , and the tap was an exudate with ph 7.51 ,
glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , ldh 38. there were 756
white blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%
mesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid was
grossly blood. cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteria
and fungal growth. gram stain showed no organisms , no
polymorphonuclear cells. vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48
hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. given
his recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will be
continued for 2 weeks after discharge. ofloxacin will also be
continued for the same. all cultures from this hospitalization are
negative to date.
2. cardiovascular. the patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction. vq scan was low probability on admission. this was
performed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. lower extremity
noninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative for
deep vein thrombosis. the patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.
the patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initial
dyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestive
heart failure. his admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , and
weight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. with aggressive diuresis
during hospitalization , lasix was discontinued on the day prior to
discharge. digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was
1.0. the patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolic
blood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. captopril and
lopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during his
hospitalization. on discharge , he was on a stable dose of
captopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and lopressor , 12.5
milligrams twice a day. he was not orthostatic on the day prior to
discharge.
3. renal. the patient was aggressively diuresed. his bun and
creatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and
2.6 on 20 of november subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on
9 of july , bun was 37 , creatinine 2.2. the patient had an
eosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of march , and subsequently
decreased to 11% on discharge. urine eosinophils were not present.
it appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , which
was discontinued on 24 of january it is unlikely that his increasing
renal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. more
likely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken to
decrease his congestive heart failure. follow-up laboratory values
will likely reveal improvement in bun and creatinine status , as
well as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.
4. psychiatry. the patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,
and has been treated successfully with ativan , but serax resulted
in nightmares. the patient has a history of depression and may
benefit from counseling. the patient's decreased oral intake ,
nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlying
depressive component over his prolonged illness.
5. endocrine. the patient's blood sugar levels have been well
controlled on a regimen of nph , 20 each morning. he has not
required any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage has
been discontinued for 2 days.
disposition: condition on discharge is fair. medications on
discharge are tylenol , 650 milligrams by mouth every
4 hours as needed for headache , enteric-coated aspirin , 325
milligrams by mouth each day , captopril , 6.25 milligrams by mouth
every 8 hours , held if systolic blood pressure is less than 85 ,
digoxin , 0.125 milligrams by mouth each day , benadryl , 25 to 50
milligrams by mouth every 4 hours as needed for itching , colace ,
100 milligrams by mouth twice a day , nph insulin , 20 units
subcutaneously each morning , atrovent inhaler , 2 puffs 4 times a
day , ativan , 0.5 to 1 milligram by mouth every 6 hours as needed
for anxiety and insomnia , lopressor , 12.5 milligrams by mouth twice
a day , held for systolic blood pressure less than 80 or heart rate
less than 60 , niferex , 150 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
percocet , 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain ,
sarna lotion topically to back as needed , vancomycin , 1 gram
intravenously every 48 hours times 10 days , axid , 150 milligrams by
mouth twice a day , ofloxacin , 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day
times 7 days.
the patient will be transferred to manhill county hospital
on 5 of september he will have a follow-up appointment with dr. andaverde
in approximately 2 weeks.

been complaining of shortness of breath over the month prior to
admission with no dyspnea on exertion or chest pain. while in
the emergency department , he had respiratory distress with o2
oxygen saturations 69%. an echocardiogram was done at that time.

brief operative note:
date of surgery , 2/18/05.
preoperative diagnosis:
see magna valve three months prior. epl on echo showed grossly
mobile on the stable aortic valve prosthesis moderate , mr. no
vegetations.
procedure:
reoperation of ascending aortic dissection , aortic valve
replacement , #24 homograph , mvp with alfieri suture.
bypass time:
355 minutes ,
crossclamp time:
265 minutes.
one ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal
tube , two left pleural tubes and two right pleural tubes were
placed.
findings:
dense inflammatory edematous scar tissue throughout pericardium ,
especially periaortic. right axillary cannulation with 6 mm
hemashield side. percutaneous right cf decannulation.
uneventful re-sternotomy.
previous svg pda injured during dissection , repaired with
interrupted 7-0 prolene. aortic valve prosthesis dehisced 3/4 of
circumference with question of an abscess cavity near lcc/rcc
junction. debridement , the annulus is of extensive inflammatory
tissue. previous dacron aortic root patch removed due to pocket
of pus on the anterior aspect. no. 24 allograft placed with
double layer proximal suture line. svg and both coronary
arteries implanted as buttons. distal suture line continuous 4-0
prolene. transaortic and mitral valves replaced.
after the operation , the patient was transferred to the cardiac
intensive care unit in stable condition. his postoperative
course was complicated by the following:
1. infectious disease: although , mr. ownbey had multiple blood
cultures , sent , they all proved to be negative as of the date of
discharge. although mr. cavitt was never felt to be bacteremic ,
the cultures that were sent from the operating room were of the
aortic valve prosthesis. this never showed the organisms
identified on gram stain and mssa stain. however , the infectious
disease physicians were consulted and felt that mr. sanjurjo should
be on vancomycin , rifampin , and gentamicin. as at the time of
discharge , mr. bersamin has finished his regimen of gentamicin and
will continue to be on both vancomycin and rifampin until
11/12/04. the rifampin he will take orally and the vancomycin he
will get after dialysis three times a week. while an inpatient ,
mr. rakus never had any evidence of leukocytosis or bacteremia.
2. cardiovascular: ms. johe was noted to have a first-degree
av block on postoperative day #7 with a pr interval of 0.35. up
into this point he had been receiving labetalol. this was held
and the electrophysiology consult was obtained. the
electrophysiology service saw the patient agreed to be an
excellent candidate for permanent pacemaker. initially they
attempted to gain access to the right brachiocephalic/subclavian.
however , this proved to be difficult and ultimately obtain
access through the left iliac. his permanent pacemaker was
placed on 10/3/05 and was interrogated the following day and
felt to be functioning appropriately. he was restarted on his
labetalol and as of the time of discharge , has had no symptoms.
other than the above , ms. dingman was weaned from his oxygen
requirement , mobilized rapidly following surgery. all epicardial
pacing wires and chest tubes were removed without complication.
he will be discharged home on the following medications aspirin
325 mg p.o. daily , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , labetalol100
mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg p.o.

discharge date:
attending: burt everett penisson m.d.
discharge date: to be determined.
service: gms ra
primary diagnosis: failure to thrive.
secondary diagnoses: congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , postherpetic neuralgia , atrial fibrillation , and urinary
tract infection.
history of present illness: this is an 87-year-old female with a
history of congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation status
post pacemaker placement , and chronic venous stasis who presents
with nausea , vomiting , and failure to thrive. the patient was
recently admitted to tapo waycent smouthnew community hospital in early
october with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and lower
extremity cellulitis. she was treated with diuresis ( ultimately
with ethacrynic acid as she developed a rash on torsemide and
itching with lasix ) and a seven-day course of levofloxacin. at
the end of this admission , she was sent to a rehabilitation
facility. the patient had returned on the day of admission to
see her primary care physician. she had been vomiting and
appears severely dehydrated. she reported nausea and vomiting
for eight to nine days , intermittent nonbloody , nonbilious. she
also reported dysphagia for the last two months. she describes
recent dysuria. she also states that she has had no bowel
movement for a week prior to admission. she has had flatus. she
also complains of a baseline right ear pain due to her
postherpetic neuralgia. she has significantly decreased p.o.
intake with increasing generalized weakness. she denies chest
pain or shortness of breath.
past medical history: congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , t6 fracture and lower back pain , history of herpes zoster
with postherpetic neuralgia affecting the right face and ear ,
atrial fibrillation status post pace replacement , and history of
guaiac-positive stools.
medications: colace , senna , lisinopril 5 mg q. day , lopressor 25
mg b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , oxycontin 10 mg
q.12h. , calcium 500 mg t.i.d. , neurontin 100 mg b.i.d. , fosamax
70 mg q. week , protonix 40 mg q. day , and ethacrynic acid 25 mg
b.i.d.
allergies: lasix , torsemide , penicillin , erythromycin , capsicum ,
and quinidine.
social history: recently at the orva sonapa alblands in
me , otherwise , lives alone in rham en ma at baseline is
ambulatory with a walker. remote history of tobacco , quit 50
years ago. no history of alcohol use.
family history: asthma and heart disease in three brothers.
physical examination on admission: temperature 96 , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 119/56 , respiratory rate of 20 , o2 sat 99% on
room air. the patient is alert , but uncomfortable and ill
appearing. heent: pupils equal and reactive to light.
extraocular movements intact. mucous membranes are dry.
oropharynx is otherwise clear. there is ptosis of the right lid
( baseline ) and exquisite tenderness over the right base and right
ear. neck: jvp is 7 cm. neck is otherwise supple with no
tenderness to palpation. cardiovascular: regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally. abdomen: soft , nontender ,
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds. foley in place
draining a dark , cloudy urine. extremities: violaceous skin
changes of the legs bilaterally. 2+ edema. there is an area of
erythema in the left medial great toe , but no evidence of
infected ulceration. neuro: alert and oriented x3. cranial
nerves intact ( except right lid ptosis ). the patient did not
feel well enough to cooperate with a full neurologic exam , but
her strength was symmetric throughout.
labs on admission: remarkable for a chemistry panel within
normal limits. bun was 22 , creatinine 1.1 , white count was
13.27 , hematocrit 41.4 , platelets 448 , 000 , alt 25 , ast 35 ,
alkaline phosphatase 339 , total bilirubin 1.0 , albumin 4.0 ,
amylase 39 , and lipase 14.
impression: an 87-year-old female presenting with nausea ,
vomiting , and dehydration as well as dysuria , most likely mainly
due to urinary tract infection secondary to chronic foley
placement.
hospital course by systems:
1. cardiovascular:
a. ischemia: no acute issues. the patient was continued on her
beta-blocker. no aspirin was given , as the patient is on
coumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool.
b. pump: the patient was dry on admission in the setting of
nausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake. her last echo
showed an ef of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction ,
mild-to-moderate mr as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclear
etiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmhg plus right atrial
pressure ). initially , the patient's ethacrynic acid was held
given dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of her
admission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain a
slightly negative fluid balance. the patient was also continued
on her beta-blocker and ace inhibitor after she was adequately
hydrated for blood pressure control.
c. rhythm: the patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. she has a pacer placed and is v-paced. she is on
coumadin with her inr at goal.
2. pulmonary: the admission chest x-ray was read as a streaky
opacity of the right lung base possibly representing an
infiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume.
the patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lung
exam clear ).
3. gi: the patient had nausea , vomiting for several days prior
to admission with decreased p.o. intake. she also reported no
bowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. a kub was
obtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction or
free air. the patient was given stool softeners and laxatives
p.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. she was
continued on nexium for her history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease. the patient's nausea and vomiting improved overall
throughout her admission , however , intermittently returned.
there is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it was
thought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications ,
which were increased early on in her hospitalization to address
her postherpetic neuralgia. the patient's nausea improved with
reglan. nausea , vomiting was improved on the day of discharge.
the patient had significantly better p.o. intake. the patient
also complained of dysphagia for two months prior to admission ,
this occurred mainly with solid foods. per speech and swallow ,
the patient was initially on a soft mechanical/thin liquid diet
and is concerned for an obstructive lesion. a video swallow was
obtained on 3/4/05. this study showed no aspiration and normal
passage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note was
made of cricopharyngeal prominence ). speech and swallow
recommended a minced solid/thin liquid diet , which the patient
has tolerated well. the patient has a history of an elevated
alkaline phosphatase ( with elevated ggt ) of unclear etiology.
abdominal ultrasound on her last admission in october 2005
showed gallstones , but no other process to explain the
abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. the patient had no right
upper quadrant pain on this admission.
4. renal/fen: the patient was initially given intravenous
fluids for dehydration. she was also found to have a urinary
tract infection and was initially started on levofloxacin
empirically. the urine culture returned was staph aureus ( the
patient has had indwelling foley ) and the patient was switched to
doxycycline ( the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs , penicillin ,
and erythromycin ). blood cultures were negative. the patient
has been afebrile through this admission. she was also noted to
have a urinary retention on a few occasions where an attempt was
made to remove her foley catheter. this was thought most likely
due to urinary tract infection and to use opioid medications.
the patient will be discharged to rehab with her foley in place
and is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with urology on
october , 2005.
5. neuro: the patient has postherpetic neuralgia affecting her
right face/ear. she was admitted on oxycontin and oxycodone ,
which was titrated out in an attempt to make her more comfortable
and neurontin was also titrated out with good effect on her pain.
given her nausea and urinary retention , the patient's opioid
medications were decreased. a trial of a lidoderm patch on the
affected area was attempted prior to discharge.
6. heme: the patient's inr was at goal ( 2 to 3 ) on coumadin for
her history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. prophylaxis: the patient was on nexium and coumadin.
8. code status: dnr/dni.
9. disposition: the patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility. she will follow up with her primary
care doctor dr. eddie nitterhouse in addition , an appointment has
been made for her to see dr. nang on january , 2005 at 9:30
a.m. in addition , an appointment has been made with dr. storch
in neurology on october , 2005 at 11:15 a.m. and it is requested
that the patient's basic metabolic panel be monitored while she
is on ethacrynic acid. in addition , her weight should be
followed daily to check for fluid accumulation. she will also
benefit from physical therapy as she is deconditioned. the
patient is stable at the time of this dictation.
the discharge medications will be dictated in an addendum to this
discharge summary.

this is a discharge summary dictation addendum to the previously
dictated note dictated by rocky skorski , pa-c , describing
mr. yandow ' preoperative history , physical , operative procedure
( cabg x3 ) on 8/9/06 and postoperative course from 8/9/06
through 1/13/06.
while on the cardiac surgery step-down unit , mr. doncaster continued
to demonstrate swollen ecchymotic area at the left lower extremity
along the svg harvest site incision with white blood cell count
rising to 15.6 on 10/25/06 , although remaining afebrile. a left
lower extremity ultrasound obtained at that time revealed a fluid
collection along the prior svg tract , corresponding to the area with
the most significant erythema. mr. tixier was continued on
vancomycin and levofloxacin and was taken back to the operating
room on 9/6/06 for drainage and irrigation of left lower extremity
endoscopic saphenous vein harvest site. no obvious purulence was noted
in the operating room. cultures were sent from the or which
subsequently revealed no growth. postoperatively , the wound was
packed with wet-to-dry dressing , changed daily , and the patient
was continued on vancomycin iv antibiotics with white blood cell
count improving. following operative reintervention , svg harvest
site incision appeared less inflamed , less tender and less erythematous ,
with corresponding improvement in cellulitis. a plan had been made to
subsequently discharge the patient on postoperative day #13 , 5/2/06.
a long line was placed at this time in anticipation of discharge for
continuation of seven days of iv vancomycin. however , white blood
count rose to 19.4 on planned day of discharge , 3/28/06 , and ,
althought the patient remained afebrile and the wound continued to
remain clean with minimal cellulitis , mr. obanion was kept inpatient
overnight for continued observation and re-assessment of wbc. on
3/25/06 , white blood cell count improved to 14.3 , the patient
remained afebrile , and the wound continued to remain clean with
packing changed wet-to-dry daily. additional sources of leukocytosis
were sought including sputum culture , which subsequently demonstrated
no significant growth. urinalysis was noted to be mildly dirty , for
which the patient began a short course of p.o. levofloxacin.
sternal wound continued to remain intact with no sternal click ,
erythema , or drainage noted. mr. sustaire is discharged to
rehabilitation today , postoperative day #14 , for continued
cardiopulmonary rehabilitation following coronary artery bypass

history of present illness: this is a 61-year-old gentleman with
a history of chronic renal insufficiency , elevated ammonia levels
chronically , cad , ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ef of 40% in
lvh , recently discharged from longlate general medical center on 7/10
and subsequently transferred to ieu university medical center the patient
presents with increased shortness of breath. the prior admission
was related to renal failure and increased encepholopathy ( no
dictated summary available ). the patient reported doing well in
rehab for several days. however , over the past 2-3 days the

over 1-2 years per patient. the patient does report that he had
a foley in during the prior admission , and has had increased
hematuria since that discharge. the patient denies chest pain.

social history: the patient lives with wife. no tobacco or
alcohol history.
physical examination: the patient was afebrile with a heart rate
of 82 , blood pressure 132/72 , respiratory rate 94% on room air ,
weight 420 lbs. general: morbidly obese , speaking in full
sentences. heent: oropharynx clear , anicteric sclerae. neck:
jvp less than 6 cm though difficult to assess secondary to
habitus. no lymphadenopathy. cardiovascular: rrr , no mrg , no
s3 or s4 appreciated. lungs: increased crackles at the bases.
abdomen: obese , no obvious liver edge , no fluid wave.
extremities: lower extremity edema approximately 2-3+. skin:
the patient with chronic excoriations on abdomen ( the patient
reports they have been improving over the past year ) , and the
patient also with chronic ulcer/lesions throughout lower legs
bilaterally. neuro: the patient was alert and oriented x3.
motor strength someone decreased proximal leg and arms.
laboratory data: sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , co2
26 , bun 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) ,
albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of
137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , lfts within normal
limits ( alt , ast , alk phos , t bili ). first set of ed enzymes
were negative. bnp elevated at 655. ammonia elevated at 83.
inr 1.2 , ptt 36.
chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries which
were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient with
obstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. ekg
first degree av block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??
vesicular block , no st or t-wave changes. ua with 3+ blood ,
15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. of note , renal
ultrasound on 9/29/03 ( prior admission )i revealed no
hydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.
ett mibi on 9/14/03 stress images only performed revealed small
area of myocardial scar in mid lad/diagonal territory with
moderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. echo performed
2/25/03 revealed an ef of 45-50% , positive lvh. inferior and
lateral hypokinesis.
hospital course:
1. ischemia: the patient with a history of cad and positive
mibi in 10/10 the patient with no ekg changes , and also no
chest pain. the patient initially continued on aspirin , beta
blocker and a statin. on 8/25/03 the patient with a troponin
leak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. the patient
also had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previously
described mibi. at that time cardiology was following and
recommended medical management secondary to difficulty with
aggressive intervention in this patient. for this admission ,
cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing a
repeat mibi to assess. the mibi was completed on 3/28/03 and
results are pending at the time of this dictation. again , very
difficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.
continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. to follow up with
cardiology for further read of the mibi test. pump: the patient
with elevated bnp and some fluid overload. chest x-ray as
described above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowly
improved from before ). it was felt that the patient's shortness
of breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. so ,
the patient's lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( from
b.i.d. dosing ). prior echo is as described above , revealing an
ef of 45%. the patient did have successful diuresis on the
increased lasix dosing. on 1/24 the lasix was lowered back to
b.i.d. dosing since the patient's creatinine began to rise.
creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on 10/14 at time of
discharge the patient is on a home regimen of lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. rhythm: the patient with a history of vt and the patient
was continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry without
alarms.
2. pulmonary: the patient with shortness of breath increased
over baseline and chest x-ray as described above. secondary to
the elevated bnp and increased lower extremity edema , the patient
was diuresed as described above. the patient does use bipap at
night for obstructive sleep apnea.
3. endocrine: the patient with diabetes on insulin sliding
scale and a.m. nph. no ace inhibitor was added secondary to the
significantly elevated creatinine. the patient's nph was
increased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars
( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).
4. renal: the patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of approximately 4. this is likely secondary
to several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraprotein
associated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). the patient was
continued on phoslo , calcitriol and epogen. the patient also
with increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.
previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) was
largely negative but were poor studies secondary to large
habitus. urology attending was not comfortable with aggressive
intervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likely
secondary to significant bph ( and associated engorged veins ).
the patient is status post targis procedure as described above ,
and hematuria secondary to recent foley trauma from past
admission. the patient to follow up with urology in the future.
a urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.
5. gi: the patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normal
lfts. this has also been worked up in the past according to the
patient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. the patient is too
obese for any abdominal imaging per ct. the patient does have a
history of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevated
ammonia , versus a hepatic source. ammonium level was 83. the
patient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.
the patient's medication of lactulose was continued.
6. heme: the patient with chronic anemia as described in the
lab section. the patient did have an episode of epistaxis that
subsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , though
also somewhat improved at time of discharge. hematocrit was
stable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.
7. oncology: the patient with a history of iga monoclonal
gammopathy status post cytoxan therapy. the oncologist
attending , dr. burrows , who knows the patient felt there was
no need for additional chemo at this time. previous cytoxan
therapy has not been significantly effective.
8. neuro: the patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,
proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. a neurology
consult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary to
deconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities ,
this is not likely secondary to a myositis. no further workup
was performed.
plan to do: the patient to be discharged to rehabilitation for
further care , physical therapy and medical management. the
patient to follow up with cardiology , pcp and urology. continue
wound care dressing changes b.i.d.
discharge condition: stable.
discharge medications:
1. tylenol 325 p.o. q.6h p.r.n. pain.
2. aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day.

20 before meals , byetta 5 mcg twice daily , levothyroxine ( dose
unknown ) , oxycontin 40 every eight hours , percocet two tabs every
3 hours as needed for pain and gabapentin ( dose unknown ).
chief complaint: syncope.
history of present illness: this is a 66-year-old man with
diabetes , hypertension , obesity and non-hodgkin's lymphoma of the
right hip on chemotherapy ( r-chop ) , which began on 11/29/06 and
will continue for 18 weeks. he reported no complications from
ischemic chemotherapy. at baseline he cannot bear weight on his
right leg and he devised this complicated system where he shifts
himself down the stairs to the bottom of the steps using his
upper body strength and a family member to assist him. all
during this maneuver he felt unusually short of breath the day of
admission and in the context of breathing heavily began to sweat
and feel lightheaded and then lost consciousness temporarily.
sister was present and called ems. on arrival to the emergency
room , he was hypotensive and received iv normal saline as volume
resuscitations. his pressures initially were noted to be in the
70s to 80s systolic and improved to 90 systolic after 4 l of
fluid from the emergency room. the patient was admitted for
syncope. on admission as part of the workup for syncope an
initial set of cardiac enzymes was negative.
physical examination: on physical exam , the patient was
afebrile , heart rate in the 90s , blood pressure systolic 100 ,
respirations 20 and o2 sat 94% on room air. pupils were equal ,
round and reactive to light. there was no cervical
lymphadenopathy. jvp was not visualized due to large neck.
lungs were clear. the heart was regular. there was an s1 , s2
with a loud and widened split p2 component of the second heart
sound. abdomen was soft and nontender. the right hip was tender
to palpation. the extremities had 1+ edema bilaterally.
the patient was admitted with a preliminary diagnosis of syncope.
hospital course: the second set of cardiac enzymes was positive
with a troponin of 2. echocardiogram the morning following
admission showed a dilated right ventricle consistent with right
ventricular strain. this was followed by a pe protocol ct scan ,
which showed a large saddle embolus. the patient was treated
initially with iv heparin , transitioned to coumadin and then the
decision was made to try lovenox therapy for long-term
anticoagulation. cardiac enzymes normalized. repeat
echocardiogram showed mild improvement in right heart function.

was clear. the neck revealed full range of motion; no thyromegaly;
no masses; unable to evaluate jvd secondary to a thick neck. there
was no cva or spinal tenderness. the chest was clear to
auscultation and percussion; decreased breath sounds throughout;
barrel chest. the cardiovascular exam revealed a nearly inaudible
s1 and s2; no murmurs audible. the abdomen was soft and
protuberant; nontender; normal bowel sounds. the extremities were
without clubbing , cyanosis , clear edema or calf tenderness or
swelling. the neuro exam was nonfocal. the rectal exam revealed

cpk 72 on admission. the chest x-ray showed fat in the
mediastinum , normal heart , no infiltrate or effusion. a kub showed
no obstruction or free air. a tagged red blood cell scan in the ew
was negative for bleeding source. the ekg showed a normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 90; frequent pvcs; intervals 0.15 , 0.07 and
0.39; axis 40 degrees; flipped t wave in l; flat ts in v6.
hospital course: #1 ) angina. the patient was admitted with a
story classic for angina. he was admitted for a
rule out mi protocol. his ekg remained essentially unchanged. he
was noted to be in bigeminy and had some frequent pvcs on several
ekgs and on monitor , however , his ekg remained unchanged except for
some labile t waves in the lateral lead which changed with lead
placement. he was ruled out for an mi with cpks which actually
went up from a ck of 72 to a peak of 331 , but on electrophoresis
there was no mb fraction found. the bump in the ck level was felt
to be secondary to multiple attempts at a central line placement in
the ew and skeletal muscle trauma. he was treated with sliding
scale nitropaste and nifedipine for blood pressure control in the
hospital. an echocardiogram was done to assess left ventricular
function which revealed no regional wall motion abnormality , some
slight decrease in compliance but good lv function. an exercise
tolerance test could not be completed secondary to his sciatica.
on ett he went for one minute and 44 seconds with a heart rate of
81-122 , blood pressure 136/80 to 144/80. there were no st changes
noted. there were some asymptomatic vpbs and no chest pain. he
was discharged on procardia xl 30 daily and given a prescription
for nitroglycerin and instructed on how to use this. #2 ) gi
bleed. he was admitted with melena and a falling hematocrit. a
hematocrit drawn at eh in january was 48 and on admission here was
37 and dropped to a low of 28. he received three units of packed
red blood cells in the hospital. an endoscopy on 2/6/90 showed
two small ulcers in the prepyloric antrum , one measuring 3 mm and
the other 5-6 mm. both were superficial and benign appearing at
the time , and neither had stigmata of a recent bleed. biopsies
were taken with good hemostasis. no varices or esophagitis were
noted. the gi bleed was presumed to be secondary to his ulcer
disease. he was treated during the hospitalization with an h2
blocker which was to continued for 8-12 weeks after discharge. he
was instructed to not take aspirin or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs or to drink alcohol after discharge. the
discharge hematocrit was approximately 35 and remained stable. #3 )
leukocytosis. he was noted to have a leukocytosis without bands on
admission. this resolved with hydration and was felt to be most
likely secondary to stress reaction. #4 ) sleep apnea. he was
noted to be apneic at night by the nurses with sinus bradycardia
and sinus pauses during the apneic episodes. he had one sinus
pause at seven seconds. on the third night of admission , he was
monitored on a sat monitor overnight which noted him to desaturate
to the 60% and 70% range during his apneic episodes. he was
presumed to have sleep apnea and will be worked up as an outpatient
with a sleep study per dr. mittleman #5 ) renal. he had an
increased bun and creatinine on admission. this decreased with
hydration. the discharge bun was 23 and creatinine 1.1.
disposition: the patient was discharged home in stable condition.
complications: none. medications on discharge:
pepcid 40 mg p.o. daily; procardia xl 30 mg p.o. daily;
nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. chest pain. follow up will
be with his internist , dr. carbonaro , and with dr. mirabile in eight
weeks for a repeat endoscopy and with dr. cirillo for a sleep study.
discharge diagnoses: 1. new onset angina.
2. gastrointestinal bleed.
3. sleep apnea.

stenosis with peak gradient of 7 mmhg. ecg not recorded. chest
x-ray on 10/10/05 was read as normal.
hospital course:
brief operative note , date of surgery 3/25/05. preoperative
diagnosis , aortic stenosis. postoperative diagnosis aortic
stenosis. procedure aortic valve replacement with a #21
carpentier-edwards magna valve. bypass time was 59 minutes ,
cross clamp time was 48 minutes. two atrial wires , one
ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal tube
replaced. findings , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve.
weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass , she was in complete heart
block. a wires and v wires were placed. after the operation ,
the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit in
stable condition. while in the cardiac intensive care unit , her
course was complicated by complete heart block immediately
following surgery. at that time , she had to be paced and
developed a junctional rhythm in the 30s. on postoperative day
#2 , she was in sinus rhythm in the 70's with occasionally paced
beats. at that time patient was started on no nodal agents of
any kind. also , while in the cardiac intensive care unit , it was
found that she had a low hematocrit and was given 1 unit of
packed red blood cells and her hematocrit has been stable since.
on postoperative day 2 , the patient was transferred to the
cardiac step-down unit. while on the cardiac step-down unit ,
course was complicated by the following: as stated previously ,
the patient was on no nodal blockers upon transfer. she
developed rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 3 with
heart rates between 100 and 120. because her epicardial pacing
wires were functioning appropriately , it was felt that patient
would benefit from a beta-blocker. lopressor was started and the
patient tolerated this dose of beta-blocker without any
bradycardiac episodes. however , patient continued in and out of
atrial fibrillation for the next two days. on postoperative day
5 , she was started on diltiazem drip. once the drip was
implemented , she was she converted to normal sinus rhythm. when
the diltiazem drip was discontinued and her beta-blocker was
continued , the patient as of today discharge has been in normal
sinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours. of note , patient was
subtherapeutic on her inr prior to discharge. her inr will be
closely followed by greenau healt hospital anticoagulation
clinic.

hospital course:
cv: based on exam and labs , the patient was felt to be in mild chf
on admission. she was rule out for mi with negative cardiac enzymes
x3. trans-thoracic echo was done which showed ef of 50-55% with
hypokinesis of anterior and antero-septal wall. tissue dopplers
suggested diastolic dysfunction , no valvular abnormalities except
trace tr. the patient was started on an acei for better bp control ,
no betablocker given h/o asthma. on statin , increased dose to
simvastatin 80. tsh negative. the patient responded well to lasix iv
diuresis and felt that her breathing was back to baseline after two
days of diuresis.
pulm: the patient has a history of asthma and osa; she was continued
on nebs , mdi , o2. recieved 1 dose of steroids in ed , but these were
not continued since her presentation was more consistent with chf.
the patient needs cpap at night , but does not take this at home
since she lost her cpap machine.
renal: the patient has a hx of cri ( 1.5-2.1 ) due to diabetes , her
creatinine was stable between 1.7-1.9 during her admission with
diuresis and the addition of the ace inhibitor.
heme: the patient was anemic with a hct of about 28 on admission. iron
studies sent which showed fe of 23 and tibc of 367 ( transferrin sat
approx 6% ) this is consistent with fe deficient anemia. the patient's
hct subsequently dropped to 24.5 with slightly guaiac pos stool and she
was transfused 2u prbc with resulting hct 29.9. the patient has a
family hx of colon cancer and she recently missed colonoscopy in july .
should reschedule as an outpatient to start w/u for fe def
anemia and guaiac pos stools.
endo: the patietn has a hx of poorly controlled dm2 in the past with
hgba1c as high as 12 , hba1c was repeated and found to be 7.2%.
diabetes management service was consulted and recommended continuation
of lantus at 70u qam with adjustment in humalog sliding scale. the
patietn should be scheduled for follow up with diabetes clinic as
an outpatient. the patient has significant neuropathic pain in her
feet due to diabetic neuropathy , has been unable to obtain neurontin
from tion hospital , pain currently managed on a prn basis with occ
oxycodone at night.
additional comments: you should take all of your medications as directed by your doctors.
it is very important to visit your doctors for follow up to make sure
that your diabetes , blood pressure , and heart failure are under
control. if you have additional trouble breathing or chest pain or any
other emergency , do not hesitate to return to the emergency room.

nerves. his hemovac put out a total of 150 cc and was removed on
post-operative day number one. he initially was kept in a
posterior splint with anterior wings. this was changed on
post-operative day two. the wound appeared to be clean and dry and
he was placed in a short-leg fiberglass cast since there was little
swelling apparent. he had an x-ray after placement of the cast and
the position of the ankle looked to be in neutral position and
neutral varus/valgus. he was cleared by physical therapy
ambulatory , non-weight bearing , with use of crutches. he did not
have any difficulties with the cast , no significant swelling , and
was discharged on post-operative day three. the patient did have
some elevated temperatures which were attributed to atelectasis and
was encouraged to cough and deep breath.

568081755 | sah | 69443135 | | 473090 | 2/23/1997 12:00:00 am | ? myocardial infarction | signed | dis | admission date: 5/14/1997 report status: signed
discharge date: 10/19/1997
principal diagnosis: rule out myocardial infarction
history of the present illness: this is a 36 year-old male who
presented with chest pain for one
and one-half hours. in september , 1989 , he developed chest pain and
suffered an inferior myocardial infarction. he had an angioplasty
of his right coronary artery performed at that time. in april ,
1989 , he had more chest pain. cardiac catheterization indicated
left anterior descending artery lesion. an angioplasty was
attempted and he had abrupt left anterior descending artery
closure , requiring emergent single vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting. he did well until august , 1996 , when he had more
angina. cardiac catheterization showed a high grade left
circumflex lesion. percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
of the left circumflex was successful. at that time , his cardiac
catheterization also showed that his saphenous vein to left
anterior descending artery graft was patent. his ejection fraction
was 68% by left ventriculogram at that time. in april , 1996 , he
had more chest pain and his cardiac catheterization showed no
significant change compared to his august , 1996 , cardiac
catheterization. one week prior to admission , the patient had
chest pain , which was quickly relieved by one sublingual
nitroglycerin. on the day of admission , while resting , he
developed anterior chest pressure with radiation to his neck ,
associated with some lightheadedness and nausea. there was no
diaphoresis or dyspnea. he took three sublingual nitroglycerin
with minimal relief. he came to the emergency room and his pain
resolved after one inch of nitroglycerin paste , 2 milligrams of
intravenous morphine , 325 milligrams of aspirin and supplemental
oxygen. the total duration of his pain was one and one-half hours.
he was then admitted to the medical short stay unit.
medications: medications on admission were atenolol 100
milligrams b.i.d.; cardizem 60 milligrams p.o.
b.i.d.; pravastatin 20 milligrams p.o. q.d.; aspirin 325 milligrams
q.d.; sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.
allergies: no known drug allergies.
past medical history: hepatitis c; hypercholesterolemia;
hypertension; coronary artery disease with
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1989.
social history: he does not smoke.
review of systems: he denied recent orthopnea or pnd.
physical examination: he was comfortable and pleasant.
temperature was 97.8. blood pressure
124/68. heart rate 64. respiratory rate 18. oxygen saturation
96% on room air. neck without jugular venous distention.
cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. normal s1/s2. no murmurs.
abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. extremities no cyanosis ,
clubbing or edema. rectal occult blood negative.
chest x-ray was negative by report. electrocardiogram with pain
showed normal sinus rhythm at 61. axis was 0. there was no
significant change compared to a september , 1997 , electrocardiogram. his
laboratory studies were notable for a cpk of 103. liver function
tests were within normal limits. troponin was 0.0. hematocrit was
40.7.
hospital course: he was admitted to the medical short stay unit
with chest pain. he underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol with negative serial cpks. he had
no events on cardiac monitor. he had no further episodes of chest
pain while in the hospital. on hospital day number two , he
underwent an exercise test. it was a standard bruce protocol and
he exercised for 9 minutes 1 second , stopping secondary to leg
fatigue. he had no chest pain. his peak heart rate was 131. peak
blood pressure was 200/100 with no electrocardiographic changes.
his test was read as showing no evidence of ischemia. the patient
was then discharged to home. there were no medication changes.

discharge date: 2/15/1998
principal diagnosis: community acquired pneumonia.
problem list: 1 ) community acquired pneumonia.
2 ) history of myocardial infarction.
3 ) non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
4 ) recent diagnosis of sleep apnea.
history of present illness: the patient is a 65 year-old male
whose past medical history is
significant for myocardial infarction in 1996 without residual
angina , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and a recent
diagnosis of sleep apnea. he was in his usual state of health
until three days prior to admission when he began to develop a
cough productive occasionally of yellow sputum , dyspnea on exertion
and temperatures to 102 degrees. one day prior to admission , he
went to his primary healthcare provider where he was diagnosed with
pneumonia and given erythromycin and ciprofloxacin without
improvement. the following day , he went back to his primary care
provider and was given cough syrup with codeine , but without relief
and through the course of that day , he developed increasing
shortness of breath , chills and diaphoresis and so he presented to
the emergency room. in the emergency room , he had a temperature of
100 degrees with room air oxygen saturations between 90% and 95%.
he was cultured and a chest x-ray was taken which showed a right
middle lobe infiltrate and therefore , he was admitted with a
community acquired pneumonia resistant to outpatient management.
past medical history: as above.
physical examination: vital signs: temperature 100.1 degrees ,
blood pressure 130/80 , heart rate 60 , oxygen
saturation 99% on three liters nasal cannula. his heent
examination was unremarkable. his lung examination revealed
rhonchorous breath sounds throughout with decreased breath sounds
at his bases , right greater than left. he also had diffuse
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. his cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm , s1 and s2 , no murmurs , gallops
or rubs. the abdominal examination was benign. his extremities
revealed no edema. his neurological examination was non-focal.
laboratory: his laboratory studies were notable for a chem-7 that
was within normal limits. his cbc revealed a white
blood cell count of 7.3 with a hematocrit of 33.5 and a platelet
count of 130. his ekg showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 with left
atrial enlargement. there were no ischemic changes. his chest
x-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates bilaterally with a more focal
area of consolidation in the right middle lobe.
hospital course: the patient is a 65 year-old male with diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apnea
who was admitted with a community acquired pneumonia who had failed
outpatient management. he was initially started on intravenous
cefuroxime and azithromycin for likely community acquired bacterial
pathogens and atypical organisms. he was cultured and sputums were
obtained , however no organisms were ever isolated throughout his
hospital course. on hospital day number two , he developed
increasing shortness of breath with oxygen saturations of roughly
86% on six liters. at this time , his lung examination was notable
for marked increase in the inspiratory and expiratory wheezes with
decreased air movements. the rest of his examination at this time
including the cardiac examination was unremarkable. this event was
felt to be bronchospasm due to airway inflammation and he was
treated with numerous albuterol nebulizers and intravenous lasix on
which his oxygenation gradually improved to 96% on six liters.
because of the concern of reactive airway disease and perhaps
worsening pneumonia , he was at this time switched to legionella
doses of azithromycin and was started on aggressive nebulizer
treatments. however , at this time , the possibility of flash
pulmonary edema causing cardiac problems was also raised. however ,
it was noted at this time that there was no clear precipitant for
an episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure was
at baseline. his heart rate was at 70 and he had not become
obviously fluid overloaded. nonetheless , he received a cardiac
work-up which concluded that he was being ruled out for a
myocardial infarction and the following day , he received an
echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 58% with
apical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis. there was no marked
left ventricular hypertrophy. therefore , it was thought unlikely
that flash pulmonary edema had significantly contributed to his
hypoxia and he was subsequently treated solely for severe community
acquired pneumonia with a large bronchospastic component. he was
therefore continued on cefuroxime and azithromycin with gradual
resolution of his fevers and a significant improvement in his air
movement and his pulmonary examination. two weeks prior to this
admission , he was started on a prednisone taper and subsequent
underwent marked improvement in his air movement and in the degree
of bronchospasm. therefore , he was discharged home on the
following medications.
medications on discharge: 1 ) biaxin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times two
day to complete a long course for
atypical coverage. 2 ) albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
shortness of breath. 3 ) enteric coated aspirin. 4 ) glyburide 5
mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6 ) prednisone
taper. 7 ) timoptic one drop o.u. q. pm. 8 ) cardura one p.o. q.
day.
condition on discharge: the patient was discharged in stable
condition.
follow-up: the patient is to follow-up with his primary care
provider. we have also asked him to follow-up on two
laboratory abnormalities which came back through his
hospitalization and he was noted to have a microcytic anemia and he
had iron studies sent which revealed an iron of 16 and a tibc of
241. his primary care provider is aware of this and will follow-up
on this as an outpatient.
disposition: the patient was discharged to home.

hospital course: in summary , this is a 64-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post cabg and nstemi ,
chf with a known ef of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,
presenting through an outside hospital with chf exacerbation
likely secondary to ischemia.
1. cardiovascular:
ischemia: no evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.
elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possibly
secondary to nstemi prior to admission versus demand. the
patient was continued on aspirin , plavix , beta-blocker and ace
inhibitor , which were titrated to effect. the patient was
started on a statin and continued on niaspan , left heart cath
revealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% lad
stenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% rca and 100%
effused lima graft to circumflex and a 100% effused svg graft to
lad. the patient is now status post stenting the om v1 and lad.
the patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath has
improved.
pump: ef 15% on repeat echo with severe mr. the patient was
continued on spironolactone. the patient continued to be
diuresed initially and is now euvolemic. he will need a repeat
echo in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction and
determine the utility of an aicd placement.
rhythm: we held verapamil secondary to double av nodal blockade.
however , with the patient's history of widened qrs and multiple
pvcs and svt , the patient will follow up with ep to assess the
utility of aicd.
2. respiratory: the patient has no acute issues. shortness of
breath has improved. continues to complain of residual shortness
of breath while lying flat on his left side.
3. renal: creatinine has been stable at baseline. we will
closely follow status post chat. the patient was pretreated with
bicarbonate and mucomyst. creatinine remained stable.
4. gi: lfts are mildly increased likely secondary to right
heart failure.
5. heme: the patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. it
trended down status post cath likely secondary to blood loss
given the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to
38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. despite patient
remaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence of
hematoma , the patient underwent a ct scan , which was negative.
his hematocrit was stabilized. he was not transfused , as he was
asymptomatic and recently revascularized. the patient was noted
to be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thus
will need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. the patient
continues his heparin-bridged coumadin with a goal of inr 2 to 3.
in addition , the patient suffers from long-term
thrombocytopenia. his platelet count was 113 on admission.
review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admission
to norpid memorial hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital prior
to heparinization , thus low suspicion for hit. the patient's
platelet level remained stable. he should consider outpatient
evaluation by hematology.
6. endocrine: the patient has a history of diabetes on oral
hypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. the patient
was controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oral
hypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. a1c was within normal
limits.
7. id: no acute issues.
8. psych: history of anxiety , on paxil and ativan.
9. fen: the patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.
10. prophylaxis: the patient was encouraged to stop smoking.
he was maintained on a nicotine patch during his hospital stay ,
which he tolerated well. he will be discharged with a
prescription for the nicotine patch as well.
discharge condition: stable.
discharge instructions: the patient is to follow up with pcp and
cardiology as well as ep. patient encouraged to check his daily
weights and report a weight increase of more than 2 pounds daily
or 3 pounds a week to his pcp. the patient will also follow up
with inr checks as an outpatient.
discharge appointments: with his pcp , dr. qin , telephone
358-190-7457 , on 10/26/06 at 1:45 , cardiology with dr.
mccoyle at 063-315-1331 on 6/2/06 at 3:15 and with
electrophysiology , dr. kunich on 2/6/06 at 10:20. the patient
should arrange to have his inr drawn on 5/29/06 and follow-up
inrs to be drawn every seven days. inrs will be followed by his
pcp.

additional comments: dear mr. rumpf , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. as you know , you had a heart attack because your
previous stent was occluded. the interventional cardiologist restented
this vessel in the catheterization lab. please , it is crucial that you
continue taking your medications as instructed , especially aspirin and
plavix. please take these medications every day until instructed
otherwise by your doctors. please weigh yourself daily and keep
records of your weight. if you experience worsening shortness of breath
with exertion or at rest , have chest pain , dizziness , fainting , or
swelling , please call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room.
discharge condition: stable
to do/plan:
1. ) titrate coumadin to goal inr 2-3.
2. ) pt likely needs cpap machine at home ( failed sleep study )
3. ) titrate acei ( was previously on arb ) as tolerated , bb ( now on toprol
xl 200 , instead of atenolol 25 )
4. ) likely needs re-eval of lv fxn in 6-8 meeks , aicd/ppm , consider
aldosterone antagonist.

discharge date: 7/20/2004
attending: elvis culberson m.d.
date of discharge: to be determined.
service: heart failure.
chief complaint: referred by primary care physician for
increased dyspnea on exertion.
history of present illness: a 63-year-old male with copd , cabg ,
ischemic cardiomyopathy , hypertension , cri , cad , atrial
fibrillation , distant history of dvt , morbid obesity , presents
with three weeks of increased dyspnea on exertion despite an
increase in his lasix dose from 80 mg b.i.d. to 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. he has also had progressive fatigue and somnolence. he
denies pnd , orthopnea , chest pain , recently ( one week ago ). he
had productive cough and was started on amoxicillin with some
initial improvement in his energy , but has had a continuous
decline since then. he can do his activities of daily living ,
but he gets shortness of breath when he is wheeling around in his
wheelchair. he went to his primary care physician , dr. emil hattaway who felt that he was volume overloaded and noticed a
desaturation to 81% on room air and admitted him to the heart
failure service for diuresis and optimization.
past medical history:
1. ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. morbid obesity.
3. chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline 1.6 to 1.9 ).
4. gynecomastia.

the inferior wall , right ventricular function was moderately
reduced , trace aortic insufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation ,
mild tricuspid regurgitation , pasp of 36 plus right atrial
pressure.
20. hemoglobin a1c on 11/29/04 was 5.6.

7. allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.
the following medications have been stopped recently:
1. ace inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ).
2. zocor.
physical examination: temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure
140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on
2 liters. the patient was in no apparent distress at rest , but
had mild shortness of breath with repositioning. his jvp was 13
to 14 cm. he had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way up
his lungs. heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left upper
sternal border murmur. abdomen: obese , nontender , nondistended ,
normoactive bowel sounds. he had a left below the knee
amputation , which was warm and clean. right leg was fully
intact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg from
the knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and no
palpable pulses.
laboratories: sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 ,
bicarbonate 30 , bun 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. bnp was
473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. white blood cell count 6.2 ,
hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , inr 3.0 , ptt 68.9. chest
x-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiac
silhouette. ekg left bundle-branch block with no peaked t waves ,
normal sinus rhythm , t-wave inversion in i , l , v5 , v6 ( which
represent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric ,
consistent with lvh although it does not meet formal lvh
criteria ).
hospital course:
1. cardiovascular:
a. ischemia: the patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but
given his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was
negative.
b. pump: the patient was felt to be volume overloaded. his
admission weight was 130 kg. he was started on iv lasix for
diuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to
3 liters negative per day. he had a right heart catheterization
which showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure
of 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting
high left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. cardiac
output was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , svr was 695 , pvr was
174. therefore , the patient was felt to still be volume
overloaded and was diuresed further. at the time of this
dictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 on
admission.
from the perspective of blood pressure , he was started on
hydralazine and isordil to reduce his afterload and these were
titrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than
120.
c. rhythm: the patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kept
on coumadin with a goal inr of 2 to 3 except when he was being
prepped for his right heart cath. he is now being restarted on
coumadin following the cath with the goal inr of 2 to 3.
2. pulmonary: the patient seemed to have several possible
causes for his shortness of breath including volume overload and
his underlying copd and body habitus. an arterial blood gas was
done with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed ph
of 7.28 , co2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. this is
on 2 liters nasal cannula giving an a-a gradient of 16. compared
to his prior abg in january 2003 , which showed ph 7.43 , carbon
dioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. this
suggested that the patient was hypoventilating. therefore , he
was started on bipap overnight and he said that his sense of
comfort of breathing improved following bipap. at this point , he
will be sent home on home bipap.
3. chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral
effusions , which were confirmed on a chest ct. however , because
the patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be
improving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.
4. dermatological: the patient had severe skin thickening from
his lymphedema. dermatology was consulted for proper care of his
legs. they were initially concerned that there could have been a
superimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on
levofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant
clinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin
was discontinued after two days. dermatology made specific
recommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strength
dakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed by
betamethasone cream and lac-hydrin cream mixture twice a day.
there is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of the
patient's nose for which dermatology performed a shave biopsy for
concern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cell
carcinoma. this showed endophytic squamous proliferation with
atypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. this
was potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cell
carcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitive
diagnosis. deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.
5. urology: the patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urine
output into his foley. initially , this was dark red; however ,
this lightened significantly. there are also some clots evident.
the foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on his
own; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although it
appears to have lightened up. further followup will be required
likely with urology as an outpatient.
6. endocrine: the patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which
is well controlled after his recent weight loss. he was
maintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.
7. renal: the patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary
to his diabetes mellitus. we avoided contrast dye. the
patient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresis
process going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04.
the discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as an
addendum at the time of discharge.

discharge date: 6/9/2000
principal diagnosis: coronary artery disease.
history of present illness: the patient is a 66 year old male with
mitral regurgitation and a history of
congestive heart failure , who presents for cardiac catheterization
and a coronary artery bypass graft. he has a history of severe
coronary artery disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
he is status post multiple previous myocardial infarctions and
presents with dyspnea on exertion over the last several months.
however , he denies any frank chest pain. the patient's cardiac
workup revealed four vessel coronary artery disease and severe
mitral regurgitation. he is preoperatively admitted to the
cardiology service for surgical planning for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
past medical history: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus;
osteomyelitis; anemia; right 5th and left
third toe amputation; peripheral vascular disease; anemia; chronic
renal insufficiency; status post laminectomy; tobacco and alcohol
use.
medications: insulin , lasix , accupril , digoxin , isordil , and
aspirin.
allergies: to fish , which causes swelling.
physical examination: general: spanish-speaking male in no acute
distress. neck: no carotid bruits. lungs:
crackles at the bases bilaterally. heart: ii/vi systolic ejection
murmur at the axilla , with a displaced of pmi. abdomen: soft ,
non-tender. extremities: the femoral pulses are palpable
bilaterally , however , there were no palpable distal pulses. there
was no evidence of any significant varicosities. the left shin is
significant for two small eschars with a minimal rim of erythema.
his lower extremity is consistent with chronic vascular disease.
hospital course: the patient was admitted for surgical planning.
previous echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 25-30% , a dilated left atrial size , 4+ mr , and moderate
tr. there was also severe hypokinesis of the inferior posterior
wall of left ventricle. cardiac catheterization performed on
2/8 showed four vessel disease. follow-up abi studies were
stable with the right at 0.68 and the left at 1.61. carotid
noninvasive studies showed no significant carotid disease to
warrant surgical evaluation.
on 7/23 , the patient was taken to the operating room , where
quadruple coronary artery bypass graft was performed , as well as a
mitral valve repair with a #26 posterior cosgrove annuloplasty
band. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
to the cardiac surgery icu.
postoperatively , the patient's course was significant for acute and
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a low ejection
fraction , congestive heart failure , and volume overload. the
patient was weaned off of epinephrine and diuresed accordingly. he
was subsequently transferred to the stepdown unit after several
days in the icu. he continued to progress well with the additional
diuresis. his chest tubes and wires were removed without
difficulty. radiographs showed improvement in bilateral pulmonary
edema.
on the day of discharge , the patient was stable with stable vital
signs. he was afebrile , with no significant leukocytosis. his
renal function had returned to his baseline of around 2.0.

discharge date: 3/5/2001
principal diagnosis: inferior myocardial infarction.
secondary diagnoses: 1. hypertension.
2. left frontal lobe meningioma.
3. diastolic dysfunction.
history of present illness: ms. testani is a 90+ year-old woman with
a history of hypertension , prior
atrial fibrillation , who presented to the ie health on
2/14/01 with shortness of breath and some chest pain lasting
several hours at home. she was brought in by her great
granddaughter and found to have st segment elevations inferiorly on
an electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.
at that point she was transferred to hobert center
for emergent catheterization. in the emergency room she was
treated with lasix , lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin and
heparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. cardiac
catheterization showed a right dominant system with no left main
disease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percent
lesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posterior
descending coronary artery stenosis. the posterior descending
coronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residual
stenosis of 0 percent. the patient tolerated the procedure well
without any complications and was then transferred to the intensive
care unit for further monitoring. on admission to the coronary
care unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness of
breath , and no chest pain. she was noted to have a right groin
hematoma for which pressure was held.
past medical history: hypertension , atrial fibrillation , history
of pulmonary edema , left frontal lobe
meningioma as documented by mri of the brain in february of 2000.
medications on admission: lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q day , zestril 10 mg per day , isordil 10
mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.
allergies: no known drug allergies.
physical exam: temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure
140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 liters
of oxygen. general: awake , alert and oriented in no acute
distress. oropharynx is clear. crackles present bilaterally
throughout both lung fields. cardiac: regular , rate and rhythm.
normal s1 and s2. ii/vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. no radiation to the neck. abdomen: soft , nontender and
nondistended. positive bowel sounds. extremities: no edema. 2
plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. neurological: neurologic
status intact. nonfocal exam.
laboratory data on admission: white blood cell count 13.6 ,
hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.
sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , bun 100 , bicarbonate 26 , bun 37 ,
creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. pt was 11 , ptt 23 , inr 0.88. ck
number one is 216 with no mb fraction done prior to transfer. ck
number two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , mb 310 , troponin
3.49.
electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm at
the time pre-catheterization. rate of 75. two millimeter st
segment elevation in leads ii , iii and f.
hospital course: 1. cardiovascular: the patient was transferred
to the coronary care unit after cardiac
catheterization and right coronary artery stent for further
management. she ruled in for a myocardial infarction. her peak ck
was 2577 with a mb fraction of 310. troponin on admission was
3.49. she was placed on aspirin , plavix , lopressor , zestril and
simvastatin. two days after this initial catheterization on
10/10/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequently
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be to
diastolic dysfunction. this occurred in the context of her having
a systolic blood pressure of 200. she was then transferred back to
the coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints of
chest pain. electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the t
waves laterally. her cks continued to trend down however due to
the concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin and
brought back to the catheterization laboratory on 6/27/01 for
stenting of the left circumflex lesion. since the second stent she
continued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. her cks
continued to trend down. an echocardiogram was done which showed
an ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,
moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
she was managed with aspirin , plavix with plans to keep her on this
for one month , zocor and lopressor. due to a rising creatinine
after the second catheterization her zestril has been stopped and
she has been started on hydralazine until her creatinine
normalizes.
2. renal: the patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 which
increased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. the etiology is
deemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. her creatinine is now
improving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. this should be
followed and her zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and the
hydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.
electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.
3. pulmonary: no active issues currently. she did have an
episode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high blood
pressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. the goal is to
control the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes.
there is no need for diuresis.
4. gastrointestinal: the patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.
she did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. she was
transfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 and
for the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at
34. the patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is on
prilosec 20 mg q day.
5. psychiatry/neurologic: the patient was noted to sun down at
night with episodes of confusion and agitation. a psychiatry
consult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior was
consistent with dementia and recommended starting zyprexa. the
patient was placed on standing zyprexa 5 mg at night and continued
to improve on this medication. she had no episodes of agitation
after being transferred to the floor. in addition she has a
history of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with a
meningioma. this has been noted on ct and mri scans done in february
of 2000. neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgery
would not be a good option for this patient , in addition they did
not feel that the mass was responsible for any mental status
changes.
6. infectious disease: the patient has a history of a positive
rpr which has not been treated previously. she is now being
treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units
times three injections. she has one injection pending which is due
on 3/5/01. in addition she has had a negative lumbar puncture
for neurologic syphilis.
disposition on discharge: the patient is to be discharged to the
chora medical center with
eventual plans to return to home.
she will also follow up with a new primary care provider , dr. ernesto fouch at the crestsant health on 2/2/01.
medications on discharge: tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n.

discharge date: 10/24/1992
principal diagnosis: 1. coronary artery disease
secondary diagnoses: 2. hypetension
3. dyspepsia
4. adjustment disorder with anxiety
id/chief complaint: the patient is a 70 year old white female
status post non q wave mi in 18 of october , with
thrombolytic therapy and cardiac risk factors of long standing
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and history of tobacco use , who
presents upon transfer from ra memorial hospital with chief
complaint of post mi unstable angina.
history of present illness: the patient has the history of
long standing hypertension and has had
chest pain in the past including at least one previous episode of
rule out mi. she was admitted on 26 of march , to hen mo gardensworth sent hospital with
signs and symptoms consistent with acute mi , and apparently
received salvage therapy with iv streptokinase and tpa. limited
records are available from this hospitalization. the patient
apparently had a submax exercise tolerance test before discharge
which is reportedly unremarkable. upon discharge from woodgi hospital the patient additionally did well and then had three
episodes of typical substernal chest pain with minimal exertion
that were relieved with sl nitroglycerin.
on 10 of august , the patient presented to cooker view home hospital with an
episode of heavy substernal chest pressure that was similar in
quality to her previous mi. this pain was not relieved with sl
nitroglycerin. there was no associated shortness of breath ,
nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis. in the ist medical center er , she was
treated with sl and topical nitrates with subsequent relief of her
chest pain. her presentation was also significant for a chest
x-ray consistent with interstitial edema. otherwise , her
examination was unremarkable and her ekg showed no worrisome
ischemic changes. she ruled out for mi and on 21 of august , was
transferred to cnmc on iv heparin , iv nitroglycerin , beta blockade
and aspirin. at the time of her admission , the patient was without
chest pain and denied other associated symptoms.
past medical history: coronary artery disease status post mi in
18 of october , as above; long standing hypertension ,
75 pack year history of cigarette smoking , hypercholesterolemia ,
chronic dyspepsia , history of positive ppd with normal chest x-ray ,
remote history of breast cancer. past surgical history: status
post cholecystectomy , status post appendectomy , status post renal
stone removal , status post c. section x 3 , status post breast
lumpectomy. medications on transfer: iv nitroglycerin at 140
micrograms per minute , iv heparin drip , lopressor , aspirin one a
day. allergies: penicillin which causes anaphylaxis. family
history: negative for premature cardiac disease , negative for
diabetes mellitus. social history: most significant for her
husband's recent diagnosis of gi malignancy which will require
inpatient admission at ormc and the recent death of a brother-in-law
at gh .
physical examination: the patient is an obese white female in no
apparent distress , pleasant and cooperative.
the vital signs were temp 97.8 , pulse 48 , bp 140/60 , respirations
16 with o2 sat of 95% on o2 2 liters per minute. heent exam was
unremarkable. there were normal carotid upstrokes without bruit.
the chest exam showed bibasilar rales right greater than left but
otherwise the lungs were clear to auscultation , no wheezing. cv
exam showed a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds ,
normal s1 and s2 , question of s4 , no appreciable murmurs. the
abdomen was obese , soft with normoactive bowel sounds. there were
previous surgical scars. no masses or hepatosplenomegaly was
noted. there were normal femoral and distal pulses , no peripheral
edema , no peripheral bruits. neuro exam was unremarkable.
laboratory data: the admission labs showed hematocrit 34.2 , wbc
6.7 , platelets 159 , 000 , ptt 50.0 on iv heparin.
urinalysis was essentially within normal limits. glucose was 110 ,
bun 12 , creatinine 1.0 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 106 and
bicarb 29. lft's were all within normal limits. admission ck was
32 , albumin 3.9 , magnesium 2.0 , uric acid 6.2 , cholesterol 186. the
chest x-ray was unavailable. ekg showed sinus bradycardia at a
rate of 50 , first degree av block axis +60 , st elevation in leads
v2-v4 , poor r wave progression leads v1-v3.
hospital course: the patient did well over the first 24 hours of
admission. on 29 of november , the patient went to cardiac
cath. angiogram showed 50% mid circumflex , 60% mid left anterior
descending and only luminal irregularities in the right rca ,
anterior wall hypokinesis but overall good lv systolic function
with an ef of approximately 72%. average pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 20 and right atrial pressure 9. cardiac output was
4.5 with cardiac index of 2.5. careful review of the cath films
showed no hemodynamically significant lesions felt to be
responsible for the patient's chest pain. echo performed on
12 of august , showed left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal lv
systolic function , estimated ef of 50-55% , inferior posterior
hypokinesis , and trace of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation. there
was mild right ventricular hypertrophy and normal estimated
pulmonary artery pressure.
postcatheterization , the patient showed mild hypertension which was
treated by the addition of a calcium channel blocker , and she was
also diuresed for fluid overload. prior to discharge , she had two
additional episodes of chest pain that were low in intensity but
prolonged. each of these required several nitroglycerins and
antacids to be relieved. it was felt that the chest pain was
unlikely to be cardiac in origin and more likely represented either
gi symptomatology or an anxiety reaction. the patient repeatedly
expressed great concern over her husband's illness and understood
the possible connection between this and her chest pain. on 7 of august ,
the patient underwent exercise treadmill test on the modified bruce
protocol. she went 10 minutes and 30 seconds stopping secondary to
fatigue. maximum heart rate was 108 , maximum bp 164 systolic , no
symptoms and no ekg changes , and the test was interpreted as
showing no evidence for ischemia. the patient was discharged to
home and is to follow up at amc .
complications: none. medications on discharge: nifedipine xl 90

history of present illness: patient is a 71 year old male with
coronary artery disease status post a
coronary artery bypass graft times two now presenting with chest
pain. he has had anginal type chest pain for years , never
associated with numbness , nausea , or sweating. usually , they were
about four times a week but three months ago , he began getting pain
four to five times a day not with any exertion. he has had
decreased exercise tolerance. he takes one to four nitroglycerin
tablets a day. the day of admission , he felt light headed and had
subsequent substernal chest pain. he took two nitroglycerin with
no relief and called an ambulance where he had morphine and
nitroglycerin with relief. this pain was non-radiating but was
associated with nausea and urge to defecate. he was not quite sure
it was same as his inferior myocardial infarction which he had in
1973. in 1980 , he had a coronary artery bypass graft and again in
1982. catheterization in 1987 revealed that the grafts were patent
with the native vessels occluded. in 7/25 , he had an echo with
overall contraction normal , there was inferior and posterior
hypokinesis , mild anteroseptal , and diastolic dimension was judged
to be possibly global. in 1993 , he had an exercise tolerance test
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. he went six
minutes and seven seconds with a pulse of 70 and a blood pressure
of 150/70 with typical chest pain. he had a thallium at the same
time and that showed mild non-transmural defect inferiorly with no
ischemia. also on 9/2/93 , he presented with a cough and had an
abnormal chest x-ray. he was treated with antibiotics. he denies
any recent cough , fever , chills , or sources for infection. past
medical history: significant for coronary artery disease , status

known drug allergies. social history: he is a former smoker , he
denies any use of tobacco or alcohol , he lives with his wife , and
patient is from nea ing call family history: congestive heart disease
in his father , his mother had died at the age of 42 of cancer of
the stomach , and he has a sister and a maternal aunt who have heart
disease.
physical examination: he was well-developed and well-nourished in
no acute distress with a temperature of 98 ,
pulse of 60 , respirations 16 , and blood pressure 130/70. heent:
pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light , extraocular
movements were intact , and pharynx was benign. neck: supple.
chest: without wheezes or rales of the right greater than the
left. lungs: clear to auscultation. cardiac: examination showed
that he had a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs , the apex was normal , there was no jugular venous distention ,
and carotids were 2+ with no bruits. abdomen: had normal active
bowel sounds and was soft and non-tender with no hepatomegaly.
rectal: examination was deferred. neurological: examination was
completely intact.
laboratory examination: chest x-ray revealed that he was status
post a coronary artery bypass graft with
lower lobe infiltrates bilaterally and ekg showed a rate of 50 ,
axis of 0 , intervals were normal , he had early r waves , and he had
questionable st elevation in v2 , ii , iii , and f. his creatinine
was 1.4 with a bun of 24 , glucose of 106 , sodium 138 , potassium
4.3 , chloride 99 , and bicarbonate 31. he had 190 platelets ,
hematocrit of 41 , and a white count of 5.4.
hospital course: patient was assessed as having possible chest
pain and was put on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol. the pain was said to be atypical but it was
considered best to rule him out. he was also started on
ceftriaxone for a possible pneumonia. he had blood cultures times
two taken which subsequently came back normal and a pa and lateral
chest x-ray , he did not have infiltrates so that was discontinued.
he went on to rule out for a myocardial infarction and he underwent
exercise thallium on which , on a modified bruce protocol , he went
eight minutes with a heart rate of 93 , blood pressure 150/70 with
no ischemia but chest pain without episode of mild or reversible
defect , and an anterior transmural reversible defect. patient was
told of his condition and was started on a beta blocker per
cardiology. in the hospital , patient developed some episodes of
chest pain with ekg normal each time. his stomach had also felt
ascitic lately. cardiology saw him and did not feel that the pain
was cardiac with a myocardial infarction. he was placed on p.o.
pepcid for ascitic stomach. patient tolerated his inderal he was
started on well and went to 20 mg.
disposition: patient is discharged to home in stable condition to
follow-up with dr. erice discharge medications:
ativan p.r.n. , diltiazem 60 mg four times a day , inderal 20 mg four
times a day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 once a day , aspirin , persantine

brief resume of hospital course:
cc: the patient was brought to the esih ed by her daughter with the chief
complaint of left leg pain. they were concerned about the healing of her
left fibula/tibia fracture.
---
hpi: the patient is a 72-year-old woman with cad s/p cabg , chronic kidney
disease ( declined hd ) , congestive heart failure ( ef 30% ) , htn , and
hypocalcemia. she has also been hospitalized numerous times in the past
two years for chf exacerbations in the setting of nstemi. she has
preferred not to take any of her prescribed medications despite repeated
discussions about benefits of decreased mortality , prevention of
re-hospitalization , and symptom management. in april 2006 she sustained a
displaced lle tib/fib fx after banging her leg into her bed while driving
her motorized scooter in her apartment. she has been treated by dr.
russel frausto at pchcoc . she initally refused surgical repair and was
casted , but subsequent films have shown valgus angulation and poor
healing. she declined surgery ( and was a high-risk surgical candidate
given her multiple comorbidities. on 11/27/06 the cast was removed by
dr. malhotra and has been in a walking boot since then. she states that
she has pain of the left midleg that she has treated with tylenol and
that has limited her ability to try and bear weight.
her daughter brings her in today because of concern for her mother's left
leg. the air cast was taken off yesterday and since then , she has had
worsening pain of the leg. she has been unable to move it or bear any
wait. there is a valgus deformity. they are requesting orthopedic
evaluation. she denies new numbness/tingling or weakness in the
extremities. she also notes multiple chronic problems including
decreased appetite with 40lb weight loss over the past 4-6 months ,
lethargy , apathy. ""i just want to be able to walk again and do the
things i used to like doing."" ( going to the horse track , walking
outside. ) she states that she is not depressed but sleeps most of the
day.
the family has discussed these symptoms with her pcp. in the past ,
symptoms have been attributed to her worsening renal failure , cardiac
status in this patient who refuses to take any medications. she has
wanted to remain home yet has had documented discussions with pcp about
the benefits of placement to a nursing home for longterm care. family is
currently looking into assisted living facilities. she also has
requested dnr/dni status in the past.

severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
7. history of colon cancer status post a partial colectomy. the patient
has requested no follow-up for this problem.
8. osteoarthritis status post a left total hip replacement for aseptic
necrosis. since that time she has a leg length discrepancy and uses
crutches to ambulate until a recent tib/fib fx which has left her
wc-dependent.

_________________________________________
impression:
72f with multiple chronic medical problems s/p recent tib/fib fx
( non-surg mgmt ) admitted for evaluation of her fracture. she was admitted
to medicine for ""longterm placement."" yet upon interview of the family
they intend for ms. pall to go home after this hospital stay. from
there , she will transition to assisted living. over the last few months ,
she has declined to take any medications or treatment for her chronic
kidney disease or cardiac disease. this has led to progressive renal
disease , electrolyte abnormalities and myopathy. the family brings her
in with concerns regarding her left leg. while they do want to
transition to assisted living , they do not intend to place her directly
from duomc to rh or rehab. they hope she will go home after this hospital
stay and continue with vna/services.
ortho: tib/fib fracture. non-surgically managed. followed by dr.
alirez seen by orthopedic service who discussed the 2 options:
casting with patellar tendon bearing cast or surgery. as before ,
patient declined surgery ( this decision has been supported by her pcp and
cardiologist as she is a high risk surgical candidate. ) there were no
casting technicians in-house this weekend. therefore she will followup in
the orthopedics clinic on wednesday , as instructed by the ortho resident
on call.

additional comments: no changes were made to your medications. we strongly advise you to take
the medications that your cardiologist and primary care doctor have
prescribed.
.
you were seen by the orthopedic surgery service while you were in
hospital and the recommendation is that you are fitted for a special cast
called a ""patellar tendon bearing cast.""
.
please contact the orthopedics clinic first thing on tuesday am
583-238-0172. they will arrange for you to see dr. paonessa on

brief resume of hospital course:
50 y.o. female with multiple medical problems
including obesity , iddm , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , sleep
apnea presents with worsening sob x 1 month. she reports that
following a pneumonia about 1 year ago , she has
felt progressively short of breath. over the
past month , her symptoms have become
incerasingly bothersome , interfering with her ability to
talk , walk , and exert herself. she denies
fever/chills/ chest pain/palpitations/pnd , but does report
4 pillow orthopnea ( increased from 2 ) , nocturia
( at baseline ). she presented to her pulmonologist
5/6 who felt that her lung disease was
most consistent with restrictive lung disease due
to her obesity. she presented to her allergist
3 days pta , who felt that she had a cxr
consistent with chf and increased her lasix to 100 qdx 3 days
with some effect. she presented to her pcp on the
day of admission and was noted to have a decreased
o2 sat; she was sent to tsgh for further evaluation.
of note , she has many allergies , including latex , was a 1.5 ppd smoker
x 30 years , quit one and a half years ago , and has recently started a
weight loss program , losing 22 pounds in 3
