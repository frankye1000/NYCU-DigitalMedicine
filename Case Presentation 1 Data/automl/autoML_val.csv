cerebrovascular accident in1994 , gastroesophageal reflux disease , recurrent transient ischemicattack , who was in her usual state of health until the day prior toadmission when she developed chest burning 3 days ago. thesymptoms were associated with nausea. she tried maalox and h2blocker without relief. the patient had stuttering symptoms offand on throughout the day and night without relief. she wasbrought in to bmc today , given aspirin , sublingual nitroglycerinand transferred to the montexo medical center for furtherevaluation. in the emergency room , her systolic blood pressure is130. she was tachycardic , and she was given iv nitroglycerin. thepatient then became hypotensive due to overaggressivenitroglycerin. the patient received inderal for tachycardia. notirofiban was given given her history of cerebrovascular accident.her chest burning was not resolved with iv nitroglycerin. she wasgiven morphine sulfate x 2 mg , inderal and an esmolol drip.past medical history: 1.

examination: blood pressure 132/84. heart rate 94.o2 saturation 93% on 2 liters. sclerae wereanicteric. the lungs were clear. heart was tachycardic , regularwith no murmurs , rubs or gallops. abdomen was with slighthepatomegaly. normal bowel sounds with slight right upper quadrantpain. lower extremities were without edema.laboratory data: ck 336 with an mb of 9.7. troponin was 8.4.chem-7 was normal with a bun of 8 and acreatinine of 0.9. hematocrit was 42. white count was 7.platelets 196. ekg showed a normal sinus rhythm with left axisdeviation , normal intervals. there were q-waves inferiorly andanteriorly with poor r-wave progression and persistent s in v6.there were slight st segment increased elevations in v2 of 1 mm andt-wave inversions in v2 through v6.hospital course: due to her history of cerebrovascular accident ,no thrombolysis was attempted. she was admittedto the coronary care unit and treated overnight with increaseddosages of beta blocker and had intermittent symptoms. she went tocatheterization and was found to have 100% left anterior descendingwith right to left collaterals and poor distal flow as well as a90% mid and 90% distal right coronary artery with significantvessel tortuosity. the left anterior descending was percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplastied with question of distaldissection which required stent placement. it led to initial goodresult. a wire was passed through the stent , but no balloon couldbe passed. there was no proximal stent placed due to poor outflow.the plan was to return to catheterization laboratory to attemptright coronary artery stenting. however , she subsequently spiked atemperature to 103 degrees fahrenheit. she was pan cultured andher sheaths were removed. no antibiotics were started at thattime. her urine subsequently grew greater than 100 , 000 e. coli ,and she was started on levofloxacin with plan for a repeatcatheterization once afebrile x 24 hours. she underwent repeatcatheterization and had percutaneous transluminal coronaryangioplasty of the right coronary artery lesion. she wastransferred to the floor on 3/3 on the night at the procedure ,she had an episode of desaturation to the mid 80 percent range onroom air. a chest x-ray revealed a question of congestive heartfailure vs. a right upper lobe infiltrate. she had another feverto 102.2 , and she

described visual perception about her room beingsmaller and was complaining about changes in her medicationswithout her being informed. psychiatry felt that she was deliriousand they recommended getting her family more involved to helpreorient the patient. on 3/15 , the patient was oriented and in herusual state of mental status according to her cardiologist , dr.greever the patient was demanding to go home at that time. dr.janikowski preferred to have a dobutamine mibi test performed prior toher discharge , but it was decided that this could be done at alater time as an outpatient.medications on discharge: 1. acyclovir 800 mg po five times a dayfor 5 days. 2. aspirin 325 mg po q.d.3. atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d. 4. synthroid 175 mcg po q.d. 5.nitroglycerin sublingual

c5-c6 and c6-c7 disk disease , status post left nephrectomyfor renal cell carcinoma , hyperplastic polyps in 1993 and alsostatus post aicd and dual chamber pacer.history of present illness: the patient is a 73-year-old malewell known to the chf service with long-standing new york heartassociation class 3b idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presentingwith shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the lastnight prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. the patient first wentto an medical center er then left ama without further treatment afterwaiting four hours. he reports increasing cough with whitesputum since 5/8 , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea especiallyover the last three days. also there is a questionable increasein abdominal distention. the patient had been admitted fivetimes in the last six months with the last admission also forworsening dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and cough in which henotably had a tee-guided cardioversion and diuresis. he wasdischarged on creatinine of 1.7. the patient freely admits thathe has had dietary indiscretion over the last two months ,claiming that he has been ""eating like a horse"" with meat andheavy sauces on pasta. the patient denies chest pain , fevers ,sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea.allergies: the patient has allergies to erythromycin andpenicillin , which causes a rash. he also describes an allergy tocontrast.physical examination: the patient was alert and oriented and inno acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80beats per minute. his heent exam was unremarkable. carotidupstrokes were brisk without bruits. there were no thyromegalyand his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion.cardiac exam did demonstrate jvp of about 18 cm and also regularrate and rhythm with an s1 , s2 as well as an s3 and 1/6holosystolic murmur at the apex. the abdominal exam was notablefor an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatilepalpable liver edge. there was no tenderness to palpation. theextremities were warm and with 1+ distal pulses and only traceedema.laboratory data: on admission were notable for bun of 45 ,creatinine of 1.6 , k of 4.3 and sodium of 136. the inr was 1.3.hospital course by systems:1. cardiovascular. the patient was in volume overload and hisarb and aldactone were held. aggressive diuresis was undertakenfor most of this stay including an iv lasix drip , which was laterweaned to a torsemide iv b.i.d. which was later changed to p.o.b.i.d. for a questionable reaction to the iv formation in theform of itchiness. he was also put on zaroxolyn throughout thestay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was laterdiscontinued on 7/20/05 for long runs of nsvt that he hadpossibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. however ,dobutamine was started on 2/11/05 and this dosage was increasedgradually over 8/1/05 to 1/19/05 to rate about 3 mcg/kg andthe patient tolerated this dosage fairly well. in addition ,electrolytes were repleted throughout the stay and the patientunderwent a workup for an lvad placement including pfts ,peripheral and carotid dopplers and an abdominal ultrasound. he was shown tohave significant aortic vascular disease which was felt to represent acontra-indication for lvad. discussion ongoing with the patient during hisstay revealed that he would prefer not to have the lvadeven if he were eligible. he understood that he was not likely to live longwith the severity of his heart failure. the decision was later made to sendthe patient home with a hickman catheter placed on 11/6/05 , so that he couldreceive home dobutamine. in terms of ischemia , the first set ofenzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an activeissue. there were no changes on ekg. in terms of rhythm , thepatient does have history of prior afib , however , he has remainedin normal sinus rhythm , status post cardioversion. he has hadasymptomatic runs of nsvt on the dopamine and less so on thedobutamine as mentioned above. currently he was paced with anaicd. we kept the patient on amiodarone and digoxin as well ason tele.2. renal: the patient has a history of chronic renalinsufficiency and is status post left nephrectomy. we monitoredthe patient's bun and creatinine while diuresing and although ,the patient did have an increased bun to about 70 , diuretictreatment was continued as a primary goal.3. endo. the patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics ,putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and nph doses. alsothe patient had low tsh. this is probably due to subclinicalhypothyroidism or sick euthyroid.4. heme. the patient is on coumadin as an outpatient and wetitrated his inr to a goal of 2-3. the patient did have somenosebleeds on 10/21 and his coumadin was temporarily held , butrestarted again for this goal of 2-3 later. the inr goal wasdecreased less than 1.5 where the placement of hickman catheterwith the plan to restart the coumadin after placement.5. prostate. the patient does have a history of prostateadenocarcinoma , gleason 2/5 on biopsy in 2004. this has beendiscussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient hasrefused surgery now with an increased psa , however , we didconsult a urology while the patient was here and it was deemedthat his prostate should not be a major prognostic considerationgiven the degree of his heart failure.physical exam at discharge , in general the patient wascomfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eatinghis food comfortably as far as the heent and neck exam his jvpwas about 10 cm. cardiovascular exam showed occasional pvcs anda loud p2 and s3. in general unchanged from admission.respiratorywise his lungs were clear to auscultation and breathsounds were equal

sma-7 is notable for a potassium of 5.4 andcreatinine of 1.2 with a bun of 20. cbcdemonstrated a white count of 14 , hematocrit of 42.9 , platelets289 , digoxin level was 1.2. chest x-ray showed a left pleuraleffusion which is unchanged , a new right pleural effusion +-consolidation. ekg showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,normal intervals , low voltage with poor r wave progression , nosignificant change compared with 7/24/94.hospital course: the patient was admitted with a picture of chronicproductive cough , progressive dyspnea with lowgrade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition tonew opacity on chest x-ray. this clinical picture was felt to bemostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed onunderlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructiveinfection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. thepatient was started on empiric course of antibiotics includingcefotaxime and clarithromycin. she was seen in consultation by thepulmonary service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressivediuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive interventionsuch as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. the patient was thustreated with aggressive iv diuresis with excellent symptomaticresult. as her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt thata chest ct would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe forpossible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. she thusunderwent a chest ct on 2/6/94 with demonstration of a largeperipheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of aright lower lobe pulmonary infarction. no endobronchial lesions orlymphadenopathy were noted. given the patient's history of dilatedcardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of thechest ct findings with the chest radiologist and pulmonary consultteam , it was felt that the patient should be treated empiricallyfor a pulmonary embolus. she was thus started on iv heparin withachievement of therapeutic ptt prior to switching to oral coumadinwithout complications. in addition the patient underwent lowerextremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venousthrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed noevidence of rv strain or right ventricular thrombus. of note , thisechocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventriclewith severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejectionfraction of 15-20%. though the possibility that the wedge shapedopacification seen on ct was due to pneumonia rather thaninfarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejectionfraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,and thus pulmonary angiogram or vq scan would not be likely toalter management. the patient was discharged to home.disposition: the patient was discharged to home. medications:elavil 75 mg p.o. q h.s.; captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.;biaxin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.; digoxin 0.125 mg alternating with 0.25mg q day;

course by problem:this is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease andmitral valve replacement. he was initially admitted for an uppergi bleed and was then admitted to the ccu status post v-fib arrestand found to have nstemi. his course in the ccu was as follows:1. cardiovascular:a. ischemia: nstemi. the patient had a troponin elevationbeginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the nstemioccurredand then caused v-fib arrest. the peak troponin was 111.cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,and occlusion of the svg graft. two drug-eluting

patientwas also taken off of lipitor briefly due to concern about hisliver function. at discharge , he is being restarted on hisoutpatient doses of lipitor as well as a fibrate.b. pump: the patient had congestive heart failure causingpulmonary edema. by echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30%with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe globalhypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. the patientdiuresed well during his ccu stay and on the floor. his i's ando's were followed. he was net negative , and he was dischargedat a weight of 87 kilos. the patient had an echo to evaluatefor dyssynchrony. this echo did not find significant evidence ofdyssynchrony.c. rhythm: the patient had a v-fib arrest and returned tonormal sinus rhythm. he received an amiodarone load as

the patient wasadmitted to cardiology for treatment of atrial flutter andworsening congestive heart failure. the patient initiallypresented to aler hospital in september of 1998 withacute shortness of breath and atrial flutter. chest x-ray at thattime showed congestive heart failure. the patient was initiallyrate controlled with verapamil and digoxin and converted to normalsinus rhythm. however , on digoxin , the patient developedjunctional tachycardia , which reverted back to normal sinus rhythmafter digoxin was discontinued. echocardiogram at that time showedan ejection fraction of 35%. the patient was discharged on 11 of mayin normal sinus rhythm. the patient was discharged on lopressor ,verapamil , aspirin , and coumadin , which was stopped five monthsago. the patient did extremely

on admission showed sodium 146 ,potassium 4.4 , creatinine 1.2 , white blood cellcount 6.7 , hematocrit 42.5 , ck 95 , and troponin 0.05.hospital course: the patient was admitted to the cardiology floorfor treatment of atrial flutter and congestiveheart failure. the patient was ruled out for myocardialinfarction. it was felt that the patient's worsening congestiveheart failure was likely secondary to his flutter. the patient wasstarted on lasix in addition to being started on a beta blocker.however , the patient remained in atrial flutter with poor ratecontrol. echocardiogram on 7 of september showed an ejection fraction of30-35% with global hypokinesis. of note , also , the patient'sventricular myocardium showed an echo bright appearance consistentwith possible infiltrative disease. on 14 of october , the patientunderwent cardioversion without complications , as he was still inatrial flutter and was not having good rate control. the patientwas successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythmafterwards. however , on 23 of may , the patient was still significantlyshort of breath and hypoxic. this was felt probably likelysecondary to fluid overload , and the patient was started on lasix.however , the patient underwent a vq scan and was ruled out forpulmonary embolism. the patient did well and , on 6 of april , the patientexperienced bilateral lip swelling

descending and sigmoidcolon. colitis was worse over the last month , associated withdiarrhea. abdominal ct is consistent with an infectiousinflammatory bowel process. given history of c. diff colitis , c.diff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others werepossible. ischemic colitis was considered secondary to lowforward flow , given patient's cardiomyopathy and low ejectionfraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatorycolitis or nonspecific colitis. stool samples were sent for a c.diff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples.stool cultures were

june , gentamicinand ceftazidime were discontinued , and ofloxacin was startedsecondary to decreasing creatinine. after his temperature spike on21 of august , the patient's maximum temperature declined each of thefollowing days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. thesternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued onvancomycin for the coagulase negative staphylococcus that grew fromthe wound site on 15 of may the patient had a computerizedtomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternalwound site and no abscess was seen. thoracentesis was done on theleft pleural effusion , and the tap was an exudate with ph 7.51 ,glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , ldh 38. there were 756white blood cells on differential ,

no organisms , nopolymorphonuclear cells. vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. givenhis recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will becontinued for 2 weeks after discharge. ofloxacin will also becontinued for the same. all cultures from this hospitalization arenegative to date.2. cardiovascular. the patient ruled out for myocardialinfarction. vq scan was low probability on admission. this wasperformed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. lower extremitynoninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative fordeep vein thrombosis. the patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.the patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initialdyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestiveheart failure. his admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , andweight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. with aggressive diuresisduring hospitalization , lasix was discontinued on the day prior todischarge. digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was1.0. the patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolicblood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. captopril andlopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during hishospitalization. on discharge , he was on a stable dose ofcaptopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and lopressor , 12.5milligrams twice a day. he was not orthostatic on the day prior todischarge.3. renal. the patient was aggressively diuresed. his bun andcreatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and2.6 on 20 of november subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on9 of july , bun was 37 , creatinine 2.2. the patient had aneosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of march , and subsequentlydecreased to 11% on discharge. urine eosinophils were not present.it appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , whichwas discontinued on 24 of january it is unlikely that his increasingrenal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. morelikely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken todecrease his congestive heart failure. follow-up laboratory valueswill likely reveal improvement in bun and creatinine status , aswell as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.4. psychiatry. the patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,and has been treated successfully with ativan , but serax resultedin nightmares. the patient has a history of depression and maybenefit from counseling. the patient's decreased oral intake ,nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlyingdepressive component over his prolonged illness.5. endocrine. the patient's blood sugar levels have been wellcontrolled on a regimen of nph , 20 each morning. he has notrequired any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage hasbeen discontinued for 2 days.disposition: condition on discharge is fair. medications ondischarge are tylenol , 650 milligrams by

issues. the patient was continued on herbeta-blocker. no aspirin was given , as the patient is oncoumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool.b. pump: the patient was dry on admission in the setting ofnausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake. her last echoshowed an ef of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction ,mild-to-moderate mr as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclearetiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmhg plus right atrialpressure ). initially , the patient's ethacrynic acid was heldgiven dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of heradmission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain aslightly negative fluid balance. the patient was also continuedon her beta-blocker and ace inhibitor after she was adequatelyhydrated for blood pressure control.c. rhythm: the patient has a history of paroxysmal atrialfibrillation. she has a pacer placed and is v-paced. she is oncoumadin with her inr at goal.2. pulmonary: the admission chest x-ray was read as a streakyopacity of the right lung base possibly representing aninfiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume.the patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lungexam clear ).3. gi: the patient had nausea , vomiting for several days priorto admission with decreased p.o. intake. she also reported nobowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. a kub wasobtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction orfree air. the patient was given stool softeners and laxativesp.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. she wascontinued on nexium for her history of gastroesophageal refluxdisease. the patient's nausea and vomiting improved overallthroughout her admission , however , intermittently returned.there is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it wasthought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications ,which were increased early on in her hospitalization to addressher postherpetic neuralgia. the patient's nausea improved withreglan. nausea , vomiting was improved on the day of discharge.the patient had significantly better p.o. intake. the patientalso complained of dysphagia for two months prior to admission ,this occurred mainly with solid foods. per speech and swallow ,the patient was initially on a soft mechanical/thin liquid dietand is concerned for an obstructive lesion. a video swallow wasobtained on 3/4/05. this study showed no aspiration and normalpassage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note wasmade of cricopharyngeal prominence ). speech and swallowrecommended a minced solid/thin liquid diet , which the patienthas tolerated well. the patient has a history of an elevatedalkaline phosphatase ( with elevated ggt ) of unclear etiology.abdominal ultrasound on her last admission in october 2005showed gallstones , but no other process to explain theabnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. the patient had no rightupper quadrant pain on this admission.4. renal/fen: the patient was initially given intravenousfluids for dehydration. she was also found to have a urinarytract infection and was initially started on levofloxacinempirically. the urine culture returned was staph aureus ( thepatient has had indwelling foley ) and the patient was switched todoxycycline ( the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs , penicillin ,and erythromycin ). blood cultures were negative. the patienthas been afebrile through this admission. she was also noted tohave a urinary retention on a few occasions where an attempt wasmade to remove her foley catheter. this was thought most likelydue to urinary tract infection and to use opioid medications.the patient will be discharged to rehab with her foley in placeand is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with urology onoctober , 2005.5. neuro: the patient has postherpetic neuralgia affecting herright face/ear. she was admitted on oxycontin and oxycodone ,which was titrated out in an attempt to make her more comfortableand neurontin was also titrated out with good effect on her pain.given her nausea and urinary retention , the patient's opioidmedications were decreased. a trial of a lidoderm patch on theaffected area was attempted prior to discharge.6. heme: the patient's inr was at goal ( 2 to 3 ) on coumadin forher history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.7. prophylaxis: the patient was on nexium and coumadin.8. code status: dnr/dni.9. disposition: the patient will be discharged to arehabilitation facility. she will follow up with her

while in the cardiac intensive care unit , hercourse was complicated by complete heart block immediatelyfollowing surgery. at that time , she had to be paced anddeveloped a junctional rhythm in the 30s. on postoperative day#2 , she was in sinus rhythm in the 70's with occasionally pacedbeats. at that time patient was started on no nodal agents ofany kind. also , while in the cardiac intensive care unit , it wasfound that she had a low hematocrit and was given 1 unit ofpacked red blood cells and her hematocrit has been stable since.on postoperative day 2 , the patient was transferred to thecardiac step-down unit. while on the cardiac step-down unit ,course was complicated by the following: as stated previously ,the patient was on no nodal blockers upon transfer. shedeveloped rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 3 withheart rates between 100 and 120. because her epicardial pacingwires were functioning appropriately , it was felt that patientwould benefit from a beta-blocker. lopressor was started and thepatient tolerated this dose of beta-blocker without anybradycardiac episodes. however , patient continued in and out ofatrial fibrillation for the next two days. on postoperative day5 , she was started on diltiazem drip. once the drip wasimplemented , she was she converted to normal sinus rhythm. whenthe diltiazem drip was discontinued and her beta-blocker wascontinued , the patient as of today discharge has been in normalsinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours. of note , patient wassubtherapeutic on her inr prior to discharge. her inr will

present illness: the patient is a 65 year-old malewhose past medical history issignificant for myocardial infarction in 1996 without residualangina , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and a recentdiagnosis of sleep apnea. he was in his usual state of healthuntil three days prior to admission when he began to develop acough productive occasionally of yellow sputum , dyspnea on exertionand temperatures to 102 degrees. one day prior to admission , hewent to his primary healthcare provider where he was diagnosed withpneumonia and given erythromycin and ciprofloxacin withoutimprovement. the following day , he went back to his primary careprovider and was given cough syrup with codeine , but without reliefand through the course of that day , he developed increasingshortness of breath , chills and diaphoresis and so he presented tothe emergency room. in the emergency room , he had a temperature of100 degrees with room air oxygen saturations between 90% and 95%.he was cultured and a chest x-ray was taken which showed a rightmiddle lobe infiltrate and therefore , he was admitted with acommunity acquired pneumonia resistant to outpatient management.past medical history: as above.physical examination: vital signs: temperature 100.1 degrees ,blood pressure 130/80 , heart rate 60 , oxygensaturation 99% on three liters nasal cannula. his heentexamination was unremarkable. his lung examination revealedrhonchorous breath sounds throughout with decreased breath soundsat his bases , right greater than left. he also had diffuseinspiratory and expiratory wheezes. his cardiac examinationrevealed a regular rate and rhythm , s1 and s2 , no murmurs , gallopsor rubs. the abdominal examination was benign. his extremitiesrevealed no edema. his neurological examination was non-focal.laboratory: his laboratory studies were notable for a chem-7 thatwas within normal limits. his cbc revealed a whiteblood cell count of 7.3 with a hematocrit of 33.5 and a plateletcount of 130. his ekg showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 with leftatrial enlargement. there were no ischemic changes. his chestx-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates bilaterally with a more focalarea of consolidation in the right middle lobe.hospital course: the patient is a 65 year-old male with diabetesmellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apneawho was admitted with a community acquired pneumonia who had failedoutpatient management. he was initially started on intravenouscefuroxime and azithromycin for likely community acquired bacterialpathogens and atypical organisms. he was cultured and sputums wereobtained , however no organisms were ever isolated throughout hishospital course. on hospital day number two , he developedincreasing shortness of breath with oxygen saturations of roughly86% on six liters. at this time , his lung examination was notablefor marked increase in the inspiratory and expiratory wheezes withdecreased air movements. the rest of his examination at this timeincluding the cardiac examination was unremarkable. this event wasfelt to be bronchospasm due to airway inflammation and he wastreated with numerous albuterol nebulizers and intravenous lasix onwhich his oxygenation gradually improved to 96% on six liters.because of the concern of reactive airway disease and perhapsworsening pneumonia , he was at this time switched to legionelladoses of azithromycin and was started on aggressive nebulizertreatments. however , at this time , the possibility of flashpulmonary edema causing cardiac problems was also raised. however ,it was noted at this time that there was no clear precipitant foran episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure wasat baseline. his heart rate was at 70 and he had not becomeobviously fluid overloaded. nonetheless , he received a cardiacwork-up which concluded that he was being ruled out for amyocardial infarction and the following day , he received anechocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 58% withapical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis. there was no markedleft ventricular hypertrophy. therefore , it was thought unlikelythat flash pulmonary edema had significantly contributed to hishypoxia and he was subsequently treated solely for severe communityacquired pneumonia with a large bronchospastic component. he wastherefore continued on cefuroxime and azithromycin with gradualresolution of his fevers and a significant improvement in his airmovement and his pulmonary examination. two weeks prior to thisadmission , he was started on a prednisone taper and subsequentunderwent marked improvement in his air movement and in the degreeof bronchospasm. therefore , he was discharged home on thefollowing medications.medications on discharge: 1 )

with a known ef of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,presenting through an outside hospital with chf exacerbationlikely secondary to ischemia.1. cardiovascular:ischemia: no evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possiblysecondary to nstemi prior to admission versus demand. thepatient was continued on aspirin , plavix , beta-blocker and aceinhibitor , which were titrated to effect. the patient wasstarted on a statin and continued on niaspan , left heart cathrevealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% ladstenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% rca and 100%effused lima graft to circumflex and a 100% effused svg graft tolad. the patient is now status post stenting the om v1 and lad.the patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath hasimproved.pump: ef 15% on repeat echo with severe mr. the patient wascontinued on spironolactone. the patient continued to bediuresed initially and is now euvolemic. he will need a repeatecho in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction anddetermine the utility of an aicd placement.rhythm: we held verapamil secondary to double av nodal blockade.however , with the patient's history of widened qrs and multiplepvcs and svt , the patient will follow up with ep to assess theutility of aicd.2. respiratory: the patient has no acute issues. shortness ofbreath has improved. continues to complain of residual shortnessof breath while lying flat on his left side.3. renal: creatinine has been stable at baseline. we willclosely follow status post chat. the patient was pretreated withbicarbonate and mucomyst. creatinine remained stable.4. gi: lfts are mildly increased likely secondary to rightheart failure.5. heme: the patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. ittrended down status post cath likely secondary to blood lossgiven the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. despite patientremaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence ofhematoma , the patient underwent a ct scan , which was negative.his hematocrit was stabilized. he was not transfused , as he wasasymptomatic and recently revascularized. the patient was notedto be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thuswill need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. the patientcontinues his heparin-bridged coumadin with a goal of inr 2 to 3.in addition , the patient suffers from long-termthrombocytopenia. his platelet count was 113 on admission.review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admissionto norpid memorial hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital priorto heparinization , thus low suspicion for hit. the patient'splatelet level remained stable. he should consider outpatientevaluation by hematology.6. endocrine: the patient has a history of diabetes on oralhypoglycemics , which were

however , there do not appear to be significantclinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacinwas discontinued after two days. dermatology made specificrecommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strengthdakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed bybetamethasone cream and lac-hydrin cream mixture twice a day.there is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of thepatient's nose for which dermatology performed a shave biopsy forconcern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cellcarcinoma. this showed endophytic squamous proliferation withatypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. thiswas potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cellcarcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitivediagnosis. deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.5. urology: the patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urineoutput into his foley. initially , this was dark red; however ,this lightened significantly. there are also some clots evident.the foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on hisown; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although itappears to have lightened up. further followup will be requiredlikely with urology as an outpatient.6. endocrine: the patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , whichis well controlled after his recent weight loss. he wasmaintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.7. renal: the patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondaryto his diabetes mellitus. we avoided contrast dye. thepatient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresisprocess going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04.the discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as anaddendum at the time of discharge.escription document: 1-2068440 issten telcc: dong munsterman m.d.cragoson balt cleveandtopelakefallspines atlporti acc: hilton duffie m.d.rell hospitalettegilb heightsnash chunahclellmorn hwy. , talake , massachusetts 13195dictated by: arnst , greggattending: cidre , quincydictation id 6983561d: 10/27/04t: 10/27/04"

, left frontal lobemeningioma as documented by mri of the brain in february of 2000.medications on admission: lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.q day , zestril 10 mg per day , isordil 10mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.allergies: no known drug allergies.physical exam: temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 litersof oxygen. general: awake , alert and oriented in no acutedistress. oropharynx is clear. crackles present bilaterallythroughout both lung fields. cardiac: regular , rate and rhythm.normal s1 and s2. ii/vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternalborder. no radiation to the neck. abdomen: soft , nontender andnondistended. positive bowel sounds. extremities: no edema. 2plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. neurological: neurologicstatus intact. nonfocal exam.laboratory data on admission: white blood cell count 13.6 ,hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , bun 100 , bicarbonate 26 , bun 37 ,creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. pt was 11 , ptt 23 , inr 0.88. cknumber one is 216 with no mb fraction done prior to transfer. cknumber two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , mb 310 , troponin3.49.electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm atthe time pre-catheterization. rate of 75. two millimeter stsegment elevation in leads ii , iii and f.hospital course: 1. cardiovascular: the patient was transferredto the coronary care unit after cardiaccatheterization and right coronary artery stent for furthermanagement. she ruled in for a myocardial infarction. her peak ckwas 2577 with a mb fraction of 310. troponin on admission was3.49. she was placed on aspirin , plavix , lopressor , zestril andsimvastatin. two days after this initial catheterization on10/10/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequentlyhad an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be todiastolic dysfunction. this occurred in the context of her havinga systolic blood pressure of 200. she was then transferred back tothe coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints ofchest pain. electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the twaves laterally. her cks continued to trend down however due tothe concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin andbrought back to the catheterization laboratory on 6/27/01 forstenting of the left circumflex lesion. since the second stent shecontinued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. her ckscontinued to trend down. an echocardiogram was done which showedan ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.she was managed with aspirin , plavix with plans to keep her on thisfor one month , zocor and lopressor. due to a rising creatinineafter the second catheterization her zestril has been stopped andshe has been started on hydralazine until her creatininenormalizes.2. renal: the patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 whichincreased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. the etiology isdeemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. her creatinine is nowimproving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. this should befollowed and her zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and thehydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.3. pulmonary: no active issues currently. she did have anepisode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high bloodpressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. the goal is tocontrol the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes.there is no need for diuresis.4. gastrointestinal: the patient was admitted with a hematocritof 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.she did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. she wastransfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 andfor the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at34. the patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is onprilosec 20 mg q day.5. psychiatry/neurologic: the patient was noted to sun down atnight with episodes of confusion and agitation. a psychiatryconsult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior wasconsistent with dementia and recommended starting zyprexa. thepatient was placed on standing zyprexa 5 mg at night and continuedto improve on this medication. she had no episodes of agitationafter being transferred to the floor. in addition she has ahistory of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with ameningioma. this has been noted on ct and mri scans done in februaryof 2000. neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgerywould not be a good option for this patient , in addition they didnot feel that the mass was responsible for any mental statuschanges.6. infectious disease: the patient has a history of a positiverpr which has not been treated previously. she is now beingtreated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million unitstimes three injections. she has one injection pending which is dueon 3/5/01. in addition she has had a negative lumbar puncturefor neurologic syphilis.disposition on discharge: the patient is to be discharged to thechora medical center witheventual plans to return to home.she will also follow up with a new primary care provider , dr.
