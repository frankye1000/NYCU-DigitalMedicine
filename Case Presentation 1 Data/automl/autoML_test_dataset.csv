he reports that he had some sort of a reactionto the medication. on the day after his admission , he had chestpain and hemodialysis but was relieved by sublingualnitroglycerin. over his hospital course , he continued to have2-3 episodes of chest pain per day that were relieved bynitroglycerine and morphine. he had no ekg changes in thesetting of any of these episodes. isordil was added for improvedpain control briefly. cardiology was consulted and felt that thefrequency of the pain , the rapid onset and offset , and thereproducibility of the pain to palpation made angina less likely;they did not feel that catheterization or further workup wasindicated.2. cardiovascular pump function: initially , the patient was dryon exam , and demonstrated no signs or symptoms of heart failure.he was actually orthostatic by symptoms but his blood pressureremained stable. his story of losing consciousness was difficultto corroborate; if he did indeed lose consciousness , his historyis consistent with orthostasis. management was monitored by thehemodialysis service.3. cardiovascular rhythm: the patient has an icd for history ofvt , and he is continued on amiodarone. there was concern thatpossible arrhythmia or pacer malfunction could have been thecause of his symptoms. in addition , when he fell he said hemight have fallen on his pacemaker site. on the morning afterhis admission , when he was on hemodialysis , the patient and nurseboth heard a belching sound that seemed to be coming from thearea of the patient's pacemaker. the electrophysiology team wasconsulted and pacemaker was interrogated and found to befunctioning well , with no history of arrhythmia or alarm. ekgsremained unchanged from baseline , except there was a prolongationof qtc with the initiation of zyprexa , which was stopped. thepatient's heart rate remained stable in the 50s-60s on hiscardiac regimen.4. renal: the patient has end stage renal disease onhemodialysis and was apparently incompletely dialyzed on the dayprior to admission. due to chest pain , it was initiallydifficult to have the patient complete a course of hemodialysisbut over his hospital stay he was dialyzed effectively. he hasarrangements to follow up with his outpatient hemodialysis afterdischarge5. psychiatry: after ruling out for myocardial infarction ,plans were being made to discharge the patient home and thepatient's family was called. they reported concern that did notwant the patient to return home because of abusive and erraticbehavior by the patient. they reported that actually in thesetting of the patient's fall , the police were called and whenthey arrived the patient complained of chest pain and was broughtto the hospital by ambulance. there was a history of restrainingor taking out by the wife against the patient , and she reportedfeeling unsafe with him from the home. psychiatry did see thepatient and felt that he was unreliable and was probably not safeto go home to take care of himself , but that he was alsoconfident to make decisions and was not acutely psychotic , andtherefore , it should not be committed against his will. thepatient denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. the patientwas started on ssri and initially on zyprexa though this wasstopped because of prolonged qtc. after a few days , the patient'family changed their mind and decided that they would be okaywith him coming home. the situation was discussed with thepatient's primary doctor , with the family over the phone , as theywould not come in for a family meeting with the patient and hedid go home , but will likely require a psych follow up as anoutpatient.6. endocrine: the patient continued on insulin and regularinsulin sliding scale for his history of diabetes.7. infectious disease: the patient developed a low bloodpressure and was noted to have erythema and pus from the site ofhis hemodialysis catheter in the right subclavian position. hebecame fully hypertensive and required a brief course of pressorsto maintain blood pressure. the catheter was removed andcultures were obtained that demonstrated methicillin-resistantstaph aureus. the patient was treated with vancomycin andgentamicin dose to his renal function and showed improvement inhis symptoms in clearance of his bacteremia. the gentamicin wasstopped and plans were made for the patient to receive vancomycinas an outpatient and hemodialysis in follow up. he was dialyzedfrom vaf fistula in his arm that had been created a number ofmonths prior to this admission.8. nutrition: the patient was seen by nutrition and was given arenal carbohydrate controlled low fat low cholesterol diet. hewas continued on nephrocaps. b12 and folate were normal.escription document: 4-8128309 emssten teldictated by: svobodny , terryattending: mcdanial , rickiedictation id 6569037d: 11/3/04t: 11/3/04",0

his dialysis , he noted that hebegan to feel strange. he had a questionable seizure earlier inthe day per history. during the dialysis , he became increasinglyconfused and was sent for further evaluation to the sidecoa medical center emergency room. at the cleavexo brock hospital ed , an ekg was done ,which showed tachycardia going in to torsade de pointes followedby ventricular fibrillation. he underwent a dc cardioversionshock at 200 joules and was converted to normal sinus rhythm.the patient was then intubated , as he was being coded.furthermore , there is report of the patient developing atonic-clonic seizure during the bagging phase of intubation.follow this , a repeat ekg was obtained and showed a qt intervalof 540. his baseline is apparently around 510 milliseconds. hiselectrolytes at that time were remarkable for potassium of 3.7 ,bicarbonate of 30 , and magnesium level of 1.6 , and phosphatelevel of 0.9. he did have a slightly elevated troponin

hospital , mr. mazikowskielectrolytes were vigorously repleted. he underwent an ischemicworkup for the etiology for his initial presentation. hecontinued to have a prolonged qt interval and therefore medicatedfailed to exacerbate his already long qt interval , at baselinewere discontinued. he was discontinued from his celexa andlevofloxacin. throughout the remainder of his hospital course ,mr. gift was closely monitored via telemetry and was noted tohave no further events of ventricular tachycardia.2. ischemia: when he presented , the ischemic etiology for hisventricular tachycardia was considered. he was maintained onaspirin and also continued on his plavix. a cardiaccatheterization was done on 7/24/05 , which showed 30% occlusionof the left anterior descending proximal coronary artery , 65%occlusion of the ramus , 30% occlusion of the mid circumflexartery , 50% occlusion of the marginal 1 artery , and 100%occlusion of the distal rca. none of these lesions were felt tohave

illness: this is a 63 year-old male with ahistory of peripheral vasculardisease , hypertension , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,coronary artery disease , aortic stenosis , and status post bilaterallower extremity bypass grafts who presented to the hospital withincreasing left lower extremity pain. he was taken to angiographyat which time tpa infusion was commenced. he is most recentlystatus post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in july of2001 and has noticed that , in the past two to three weeks , has beendeveloping increasing rest pain and coolness to the left foot tothe point where he was not able to ambulate. in angiography , hewas found to have an occlusion of the left lower extremity veingraft in the area of the mid-thigh with no passage of contrast andminimal reconstitution of collaterals to his foot.past medical history: peripheral vascular disease. myocardialinfarction. hypertension. non-insulindependent diabetes mellitus. aortic stenosis. he

30 mg q.d. , and toprol 100 mg q.d. andenteric coated aspirin.allergies: no known drug allergies.hospital course: the patient first underwent angiography at whichtime they found that the vein graft was occluded.he underwent tpa treatment and was brought back to angiography.this time they did not find necessarily any improvement. theconduit actually opened but it was found that he does have a highgrade anastomotic stricture of the distal anastomosis. he wastaken to the operating room on 10/23/01 for a left lower extremitythrombectomy via groin and foot cutdown. status post thatprocedure he developed symptoms of acute chest pain andhypotension. an ecg was performed , as well as troponin drawn ,revealing that he has an acute myocardial infarction. thecardiology service was called and the patient was admittedpost-thrombectomy to the cardiac care unit. at that time he wasmanaged medically for a few days. based on his severe aorticstenosis and difficulty in managing his blood pressure , the cardiacsurgery service was consulted. he was scheduled to see cardiacsurgery in office setting but , given his current condition , we weregoing to perform his surgery a little bit sooner. he did have about of pneumonia which mildly delayed his surgery.on 1/18/02 he underwent catheterization which revealed a rightdominant system , a discreet 40% lesion in the proximal left main , adiscreet 30% lesion in the proximal left anterior descendingartery , 100% lesion in the first marginal branch of the leftcircumflex artery , as well as 100% lesion in the second marginalbranch of the left circumflex artery. he has a discreet 80% lesionin the proximal right coronary artery , as well as evidence ofsevere aortic stenosis. during catheterization this revealed an rapressure of 10 , a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/20 , with wedge of31. he had a thick cardiac output of 4.77 and cardiac index of2.1.based on the findings of these catheterization results , the patientwas taken to the operating room on 2/13/02 with dr. opfer and dr.gack for an aortic valve replacement with a #23carpentier-edwards pericardial valve and mitral valvuloplasty withan alfieri suture repair , as well as coronary artery bypass grafttimes three with left internal mammary artery to the left anteriordescending artery , left radial to obtuse marginal one , and leftradial to posterior descending artery. postoperatively heunderwent our routine care and went to the cardiac surgicalintensive care unit where he generally did well.he remained on his aspirin and lopressor , as well as coumadin. hewas mildly tachycardic and his lopressor dose was adjusted.because of his diabetes mellitus , he was placed on the portlandprotocol and remained on a full ten-day course of flagyl andcefotaxime for his preoperative pneumonia. on postoperative day #1he was transferred to the floor where he did well and was able toambulate at least to a chair and was deemed that he probably is nota candidate to go home immediately but a candidate forrehabilitation. he has been taken off his portland protocol andhis staples have been discontinued.on his pre-discharge examination he is stable with clean incisions ,as well as stable sternum. he is now currently on room air andwill be discharged to rehabilitation.disposition: discharge medications: coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.hs tomaintain inr between 2 and 3 , aspirin

andwas resuscitated with one liter of iv fluids. the patient'slasix was held initially on admission. on hospital day #2 , hewas looking well. his weight was 151 pounds which was suspectedto be close to his dry weight which was reportedly 149 pounds.by 8/18/05 , he was restarted on 20 mg of lasix daily so that he would stayeuvolemic. he received intermittent iv lasix ( 20mg ) throughout the remainderof his hospitalization and his p.o. lasix dose was settled on 40 mg p.o.daily. his captopril was restarted on the 9/19/05 at 6.25 mg t.i.d. hetolerated that dose and was switched to accupril 2.5 mg b.i.d. he underwent anechocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetationon the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. this question of avegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and bloodculture were sent. the patient's temperature had been low onadmission , since there was some concern that he could bedeveloping sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood culturesthroughout the remainder of his hospitalization. he was seen bycardiology , who did not think that this echo result requiredfurther intervention and suspected that it represented a flailtricuspid valve leaflet. the patient's troponinone troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and thenanother troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting arf andacute hepatitis. he recently had a negative stress echo at thelaketon medical center , so no additional stress testingwas pursued during this admission. he was switched to lopressor25 t.i.d. and then switched back to toprol xl. his statin wasdiscontinued during the admission because of lft abnormalitieswhich will be discussed below. he was monitored on telemetrywhich demonstrated frequent pvcs and some nsvt. thisshould be readdressed in cardiology clinic. cardiology decided to hold off onplacing an aicd and was to see him as an outpt.2. gi/renal: on the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient developed new confusionand delirium. he also developed an oxygenrequirement the night before. his labs on morning were notablefor a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure withhyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( wbc 9to 25 ). he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage forbartonella as he had many cats. he was empirically started on mucomyst andacyclovir as per gi in case his lft abnormalities were due to tylenoltoxicity or hsv. he was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this wascancelled as his lfts started to normalize. he had a ruq with dopplers whichwas negative. the etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis wasnever identified throughout the admission. cardiology did not think that anyof this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stoppedonce his cultures were negative for multiple days. gi though he could of hadshock liver but he was on telemetry the entire time. his tylenol level wasnormal and his hep seriologies were negative. his labs had all normalized byadmission except for his lfts which were still trending downward.3. infectious disease: due to low temperature and question ofvegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsisalthough that never panned out. he has a history of feedingstray cats and so bartonella cultures were sent. they take along time to come back and should be followed up as outpatient. he had beenplaced on antibiotics while awaiting cultures but those were discontinued onthe 8/18/05 as the microbiology data remains negative. he had a ct scan of hischest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. he had groundglass opacities on his ct chest which were felt to be due to chf when reviewedwith the radiologist. he remained afebrile during the admission.4. psych: early on during the patient's admission , he did haveseveral episodes of tachypnea at rest. they were not positional in natureand resolved with verbal consolation and redirection anddeep breath. no associated desaturation at that time. thepatient has a history of anxiety and reported that that promptedhim to increase his lasix dose at home. he refused psychiatricconsultation or social work involvement. his valium hadinitially been initiated but it was held in the setting ofabnormal lfts. he had no further anxiety attacks after that. itis likely that he has mild baseline dementia. his deliriumresolved after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolved.5. musculoskeletal: the patient had a little bit of difficultyambulating and was seen by physical therapy who did think thatfurther physical therapy would be appropriate. the patientrefused to go to rehabilitation facility , so he was planning togo home with services including physical therapy at home.6. hematology: the patient was set to go home and then it wasnoted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady declinethroughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/lovenox. therewas concern that this could represent heparin inducedthrombocytopenia and so all heparin products were stopped. he was placedlepirudin which was chosen instead of argatroban becauseargatroban was cleared by liver in light of his hepatitis.his initial pf4 was read as bordeline positive , but the laber laterchanged the result to negative. based on this discrepancy another pf4 wassent which was borderline positive. as per the hematology consult , they feltthat despite the borderline positive pf4 he did not need prophylacticanticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in thefuture until a repeat pf4 in checked in a few months.discharge medications: aspirin 325 mg daily , lasix 40 mg daily ,toprol xl 25 mg daily , accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mgdaily.diet: low sodium.activity: as tolerated with supervision and advised by thephysical therapist.followup appointments: dr. dougall is the patient's new pcp

thegastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient wasthought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis giventhe findings on the egd and ct as well as the negative ultrasoundand kub. the gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to hisdiabetes. he was admitted to the medical service and his dietwas slowly increased. on the floor , his pain continued , andwithin two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102.he had a repeat abdominal ct , which showed a distendedgallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensivestranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acuteacalculous cholecystitis. surgery was reconsulted , and thepatient was taken to the operating room where he had anexploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an opencholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. the patientreceived perioperative vancomycin , levaquin , and flagyl andcontinued to do well post surgery with advancement of his dietand decrease in his pain medication requirement. vancomycin wasdiscontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. he wascontinued on the levaquin and flagyl. he had a drain that wasleft in following surgery , and this was pulled on 4/14/2006 .following the pulling of the drain , he developed leakage ofgreen-tinged serous fluid from his abdominal wound. an abdominalct was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess.an ercp was done which showed a cystic duct stump bile leak.they did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no furtherleak. the patient was continued on empiric levaquin and flagylfollowing the procedure. his diet was advanced and he toleratedthis well. he had no further pain. he is being discharged on atotal of seven days of levaquin and flagyl following the bileleak.endocrine: the patient was continued on lower-dose insulin whilehe was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased.cardiovascular: the patient was followed by the cardiactransplant team. he was initially switched to iv cyclosporineand his cellcept was held. these were transitioned to p.o. andrestarted following his improvement. postoperatively , he gotstress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this wasthen tapered to solu-medrol and then back to prednisone at hishome dose. he was fluid overloaded following the surgery. hegot 100 of iv lasix times several doses , and then restarted onhis torsemide to maintain euvolemia. his cartia was initiallydiscontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , butthis was then restarted. he was discharged on all his homemedications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m.rheumatology: following his surgery , he developed bilateralelbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout.the rheumatology service was consulted. a left elbow tap wasattempted , but this did not return any fluid. he was givenseveral doses of colchicine p.r.n. with improvement. the steroidtaper was slowed and his gout improved. he was dischargedwithout any elbow pain.phlebitis: he developed left arm phlebitis secondary to aninfiltrating iv. this was covered by his antibiotics that werestarted for his cholecystitis and his arm improved.followup instructions:1. the patient will follow up with the cardiac transplantservice. this will be arranged by them.2. the patient will need to follow up with dr.

failure.secondary diagnoses: 1. aortic insufficiency.2. valvular cardiomyopathy.3. mitral regurgitation.4. tricuspid regurgitation.5. hypertension.6. hemolytic anemia.7. chronic renal insufficiency.history of present illness: this is a 50-year-old man withvalvular cardiomyopathy , status postthree aortic valve replacements , who presents with no acutecomplaints but a progressive decline in daily function.mr. kozub history begins in 9/13 when he presented withshortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in thesetting of medications ( lasix and/or procardia for hypertension )noncompliance. he was found by echo to have severe aorticinsufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricularhypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. he subsequentlyunderwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valverepair. aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration.one month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacementwith dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess withcultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated withamphotericin-b , vancomycin and gentamicin. at this time , he alsorequired coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. thishospital course was additionally complicated by development ofthird degree heart block necessitating the implantation of apermanent pacemaker. after discharge , mr. buzo did generallywell for the following years until 9/4 , when he again presentedwith increasing shortness of breath. echo then revealed moderateto severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation.cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. at thistime , his aortic valve was again replaced with a st. jude's valve.again , following discharge , mr. kock did generally well until4/19 when again he presented with shortness of breath. at thattime , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitationwith left ventricular dilatation ( the systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) ,along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , andan ejection fraction of 15-20%. stress testing at this time showeda physical work capacity of 15.1. it is not documented what wasdone at this time , but apparently his lasix was increased from40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. regarding thisadmission , mr. bessemer reports that he has been feeling fine and ishere in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve ,or if that doesn't work as it hasn't the last three times , to givehim a new heart all together. he reports no increasing dyspnea ,fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. he sleeps on threepillows at night and has not recently been short of breath whenlying flat. he is able to do chores around the house withoutgetting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath afterone flight of stairs. he doesn't complain of significantdisability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heartcondition. he notes that he has not been able to participate inthe marching band over the last year , but that he can play sittingdown. mr. lonn attributes his disease to having beennoncompliant with his procardia following the cerebrovascularaccident in 1993. he says that , ""he brought on his heart problemshimself.""past medical history: otherwise , notable for an embolism to hisleft foot in 1998 as a result of havingstopped coumadin therapy , chronic renal insufficiency withcreatinine ranging from 1.4-2.2 in 2/12 , and he is status postexploratory laparotomy in 1960 from a gunshot wound.allergies: he is allergic to zestril , which gives him perioralangioedema.medications: lasix 80 mg b.i.d , atenolol 50 mg q.d. , avapro150 mg q.d. , coumadin 5 mg q.d. , zantac 150 mgb.i.d. , niferex 150 mg q.d.family history: his family history is negative for heart disease.social history: he has a 35 pack-year smoking history , but quitone year ago. he has occasional alcohol use.mr. allegrini is on permanent disability leave from his job atdes jack oxall , which involved a lot of heavy lifting. he lives at homewith his wife and 19-year-old son , and spends most of his daythere. he is active in naomin me yonkers , where he likes to play the basedrum.physical examination: general: he is a thin , healthy-appearingblack man in no apparent distress. vitalsigns: heart rate 65 , blood pressure 120/70 , oxygen saturation 98%on room air. neck: his carotid pulses variance and normal involume. jugular venous pressure 7 cm. lungs: clear. his pmi isvibratory in quality and prominent , lateral to the anterioraxillary line. he has a normal s1 , an ejection sound , and a loudprosthetic s2 , a iii/vi systolic murmur at the right upper sternalborder , and a iii/iv holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternalborder radiating to the right upper sternal border. abdomen:non-distended , with no organomegaly. extremities: warm with faintpulses.laboratory data: remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 , hematocrit33.5 , with a mcv of 83.5 , rdw of 28.8 ,reticulocyte count of 6.6 and ldh of 1077. mr. shadler had an echohere that showed severe aortic insufficiency with a severelydilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of 7.0 and systolicdiameter of 6.3 ) , as well as mild to moderate mitral and tricuspidregurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20-25%. exercise testingshowed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. on cath , his pulmonary arterypressure , wedge pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was47/16 , 13 and 379 , which fell to 26/4 , 5 , and 137 , respectivelywith nipride. his systemic vascular resistance was markedlyelevated at 2400 and a thick cardiac output and cardiac index were3.62 and 2.31. amlodipine was then started and lasix was increasedin an effort to reduce his systemic vascular resistance andpulmonary wedge pressure. the remainder of the transplant workupresults were unremarkable except for a significantly reduceddiffusing capacity of 59% corrected , a creatinine clearance of 48.4and a prostate specific antigen of 18.1. prostate biopsy and bonescan were both negative. his admission was otherwise notable foran elevated creatinine to 3.0 in the setting of perioperativelevofloxacin and gentamicin , as well as aggressive vasodilatortherapy. he was allowed to drift back down to his baseline of low2's before discharge.mr. krough was discharged home in stable condition on the followingmedications:discharge medications: atenolol 25 mg q.d. , lasix 120 mg b.i.d. ,coumadin 5 mg q.d. , amlodipine 2.5 mg

recurrent endocarditis and end-stage cardiacvalvular disease.procedures performed: mitral valve replacement on 2 of november andcardiac transplantation on 18 of september .history of present illness: the history of present illness is thatof a 55-year-old female with a historyof rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis , who presented to theside lygreen medical center on 3 of august to the cardiology service with progressiveweight gain , lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. thepatient had a history of rheumatic fever as a child , and shepresented in 1985 with mitral and aortic valvular endocarditisfollowing a root canal. she subsequently underwent aortic andmitral valve replacement secondary to her aortic and mitralinsufficiency. her perioperative course was complicated by a brainabscess which was without neurologic residual deficit. in 1989 thepatient again presented with recurrent endocarditis and underwent arepeat mitral valve and aortic valve replacement. for the past yearprior to presentation , she has had increasing symptoms of rightheart failure including lower extremity edema and ascites which didnot improve with medical treatment. she has also presented withcomplaints of shortness of breath. in february of 1993 she underwenta transesophageal echo which revealed a perivalvular leak for whichshe underwent her third mitral valve replacement. tricuspidannuloplasty was performed at that time. the patient has neversignificantly improved past her most recent surgery and her mostrecent transesophageal echo performed in ta ca elponcevo threeweeks prior to presentation demonstrated again a perivalvularmitral leak. the patient has had a significant lower extremityedema with a weight gain of 30 pounds since her discharge one monthago. she has no shortness of breath at rest but does havesignificant dyspnea on exertion with minimal effort. she deniesfever or chills.past medical history: past medical history is as stated above. shealso has some chronic renal insufficiencywith baseline bun and creatinine of 40 and 2.0. she is status postcholecystectomy in 1990.medications: her medications on presentation to the paa talc rton health werelasix 100 mg b.i.d. , digoxin 0.25 mg every other day ,coumadin 5 mg alternating with 2.5 mg every day , and captopril 12.5mg three times a day. she is allergic to penicillin and codeine.physical examination: her admission physical exam was notable fora tired appearing female with a cardiac examnotable for mechanical valvular heart sounds and 4+ pitting lowerextremity edema.laboratory data: her admission bun and creatinine were 61 and 1.9.hospital course: she was admitted to the cardiology service andwas evaluated by the cardiac surgical service , andit was felt that mitral valve repair and/or replacement would bebeneficial to the patient. she , therefore , underwent mitral valverepair on 2 of november but was without significant symptoms for herright heart failure , and was placed on the cardiac transplant list.she underwent successful cardiac transplantation on 18 of september .  sincethat time , her main issues have centered over management of herresidual ascites with diuresis of her third spaced volume.additionally she had had some nose bleeds preoperatively which werefelt to be related to nasal polyps for which she was seen by theent service. she underwent routine post transplant biopsies andechocardiograms , all of which showed adequate acceptance of organsand good lv function. she continued to do quite well with theexception of some dysphagia early in her postoperative course whichwas found to be possibly secondary to some esophageal ulcerations ,but these have subsequently resolved and she is tolerating aregular diet. she was noted two days prior to transfer to thenorri verlan medical center to have some diffuse mildabdominal pain , and kub and upright revealed large amounts ofstool , and she felt great relief from soap suds enemas. she hasbeen stable on her medications with adequate cyclosporine levels.imuran was recently held secondary to neutropenia.disposition: the patient was transferred to the holls health on approximately the thirdpostoperative week from her cardiac transplant.discharge medications: her discharge medications include mylicon 80mg p.o. t.i.d. , trental 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,nystatin cream

old examination , after consultation with anoutpatient cardiologist at perlaw memorial hospital .  the patienthad a troponin i of 0.11 , slightly elevated. the patient's ckwas 136 , mb fraction 4.3 , both within normal limits. onadmission , the patient coagulation parameters showed an inr of1.2. other pertinent data includes an orally reported cardiaccatheterization at beckry hospital in 2001 , which showed noobstructive coronary disease , but diffuse coronary arterydisease , with an ejection fraction of 50%. an adenosine mibiobtained in 2002 at peacepe planthugh memorial medical center showed possible oldinferior infarct , global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of35-40%. an echocardiogram obtained during this admissiondemonstrated the patient's ef at this point to be 25% , ratherwith global hypokinesis.operations or procedures:there were no operations or procedures performed during thisadmission.hospital course by problem:cardiovascular - the patient was determined initially to belikely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck veins , andincreased leg edema and a low blood pressure. because thepatient was determined to be in chf , he was diuresed with ivlasix , and later with p.o. lasix , the patient was diuresedapproximately 2 liters per day over a 4-5 period. the patient'sblood pressure subsequently rose. after consultation withcardiology , it was determined that a beta blocker and an aceinhibitor should be added to the patient's medication regimen ashis blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit andcongestive heart failure.because the patient was initially determined to have some risk ofmyocardial infarction , had reported chest pain the day prior toadmission , and had slightly elevated troponins. the patient'stroponin and ck-mb were followed until they began decreasing. itis likely that these very small elevations were due to smallamount of ischemia from demand , due to the patient's fluidoverload and anemia. the patient was continued on his statinmedication.the patient on admission had frequent pvcs , and some short runsof ventricular tachycardia lasting less than 5 beats. afterdiuresis , the patient had no further runs of vt , and had onlyminimal ectopy. the patient's electrolytes including potassiumand magnesium were checked daily and repleted as necessary.aspirin was withheld from the patient for now , despite having abenefit in cardiac disease of this kind. this is because thepatient's hematocrit was low and he had recently had bleedinglikely from his bladder. urology department was consultedregarding this decision.renal/genitourinary: the patient has a long known history of bphand is followed closely at cotson tionlo hospital by dr.josue grefe . the patient was recently admitted for theseproblems due to obstruction , and instrumentation. on admission ,the patient's urine did not have any red blood cells , and he hadno obvious clots at any point. after consultation with urology ,and after the patient had been diuresing well with lasix , thepatient's foley catheter was removed and after this point he hadno problem with urinating. the patient was maintained on proscarin addition to flomax.heme: the patient's hematocrit drop was likely due to twofactors. first of all , the patient is known to have been losingblood in the form of clots from his bladder. this is likely dueto bleeding from the surface of his prostate where a recentcystoscopy had demonstrated tortuous veins. in addition , thereading of hematocrit of 24.5 on admission was likely secondaryto dilution , the patient was massively fluid overloaded. thepatient's hematocrit rose after diuresis , and was maintained inthe 31-32 range without transfusion during admission. he was ,however , typed and screened , and the plan was to transfuse himshould his hematocrit decrease below 30 , given his cardiachistory.oncologic: the patient is followed closely by dr. zecchini athool norhunt general

admission.hospital course by problem:1. cardiovascular:a. ischemia: the patient has no known diagnosis of cad;however , he has many risk factors. the patient had a troponin of0.7 on admit which subsequently trended down. this troponin leakwas thought to be due to demand. the patient remained chestpain-free during his entire hospital course , and had no acuteischemic issues. the patient was continued on his aspirin ,beta-blocker and statin medications.b. pump: the patient has a history of chf with an ef of 40-45%.in the past , this congestive heart failure had been presumablyattributed to ischemic for hypertensive etiology. however ,during this admission , the patient had a cardiac biopsy that waspositive for amyloid suggesting that amyloid is the causeunderlying his chf. the patient appeared mildly fluid overloadedon admission. he was successfully diuresed with 100 iv lasix forseveral days. the patient has been switched to his home dose oflasix of 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was euvolemic for several daysprior to his discharge. his euvolemic weight on 8/10/07 was64.5 kilograms. his discharge weight will be reported in anaddendum. during this admission , he was continued on hisbeta-blocker. his calcium channel blocker and diltiazem wasdiscontinued during this admission given his likely restrictiveheart physiology with his new diagnosis of amyloid. the patientwas started on a nitrate during this admission in order to reducepreload. as mentioned above , the patient had a catheterizationwith an endomyocardial biopsy that was positive for amyloid. apanel of other amyloid-related tests were also sent out. ofnote , serum genetic amyloid testing was pending at the time ofdischarge. of note , the patient had a serum immunofixation testthat was within normal limits. the patient had a urineimmunofixation test with a positive monoclonal spike with lambdalight chain. the patient also had a serum-free light chain assaythat was equivocal/positive. the patient also had positiveproteinuria on a spot urine. the patient also had a bone marrowbiopsy done by dr. jarred canner of momh in order to furtherdefine this subtype of amyloid that this patient has and in orderto facilitate a screening of his family members for amyloid. healso had a bone marrow biopsy given the monoclonal spike on hisurine immunofixation test.c. rhythm: the patient has a pacemaker originally put in forsick sinus syndrome. he is v-paced. the patient was discoveredto be in atrial fibrillation on this admission. on 7/9/07 , theep service changed the pacemaker setting to vvi given that thepatient was in atrial fibrillation and decreased the heart rateto the 60s-70s. the patient remained on telemetry throughout hisstay which was uneventful. the patient was also started oncoumadin for anticoagulation given his atrial fibrillation andthe diagnosis of amyloid. the patient remained subtherapeuticand on 7/11/07 , his inr was still subtherapeutic at 1.5 , and hewill most likely be discharged on coumadin 3.5 mg every eveningwhich will be adjusted as necessary at the rehabilitationfacility.2. infectious disease: the patient presented with a mild cough.the patient had a fever on admit but was afebrile after one totwo days on antibiotics. the patient had no leukocytosis.again , there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray andhis clinical findings were suspicious for pneumonia. the patientreceived a five-day course of levofloxacin at 750 mg daily. thecourse of antibiotics ended on 1/27/07 .  the patient had blood ,urine and sputum cultures which were negative.3. heme: the patient has baseline anemia between hematocrit of31 and 32 which remained stable during his hospitalization. thepatient also has a baseline thrombocytopenia with platelets atapproximately 170 which remained stable throughout hishospitalization and again the patient as stated above was startedon coumadin during this admission for atrial fibrillation and foramyloid. the coumadin was slowly increased up to 3.5 mg givensubtherapeutic inr. the patient had a bone marrow biopsy done on5/10/07 as mentioned above in order to further define theamyloid ??_?? and because of the monoclonal spike on the urineimmunofixation. the final results of the bone marrow biopsy arepending.4. endocrine: the patient has a history of diabetes. at first ,he was on his home dose of nph insulin which was 20 unitssubcutaneous daily as well as an insulin sliding scale. becauseof persistent hypoglycemia , the patient's nph was reduced to 10units of nph insulin subcutaneous daily.5. fen: the patient had a low-salt diet and a 2-liter fluidrestriction and was seen by nutrition inhouse.6. renal: the patient had a creatinine of approximately 1.0which stayed stable throughout his hospitalization.7. gi: the patient has chronic lft abnormalities likelysecondary to chf; however , the etiology is uncertain.8. question restless leg syndrome: on 2/19/07 , the patient wascomplaining of myoclonic jerks of his right leg which is an oldproblem. his general exam was within normal limits. he wasgiven a trial of magnesium supplementation inhouse for this.9. low back , sacral pain: his low back pain appears to bechronic and it was treated with oxycodone successfully. thepatient also was noted to have a skin tear on his right buttockwhich showed no signs of infection and a duoderm was placed overit for wound care. the patient also had a stage i sacraldecubitus ulcer and a duoderm was placed on it for wound care andfor protection.10. prophylaxis: the patient was on dvt dose

intervals. she had flippedt waves in leads 3 , f , and v1 through v3 , biphasic t waves in v4 ,flat t waves in v5 and v6. there was poor r wave progression and qwaves in 1 and l.hospital course: it was felt that during the patient'spresentation the most likely diagnosis was apulmonary embolus , given her clinical history and her intermediateprobability of vq scan. the elevated ck with the very low mb wasfelt not to represent a myocardial infarction but to represent a ckleak from presumed pulmonary infarction. the patient washeparinized with the goal of maintaining her ptt in the 60 to 80range. she had a thrombotic work up sent off , namely anantithrombin 3 , protein c and protein s , all of which , with theexception of the russell viper venom , returned within normallimits. the russell viper venom is pending at the time ofdictation. the patient underwent lower extremity noninvasives onhospital day number one which returned as negative. she had a ddimer sent which was also normal. at this point the dvt team hereat the otver hospital was consulted , given theconflicted data for pulmonary emboli. the team felt that , giventhe patient's clinical history and the implications of chroniccoumadin therapy , that a pulmonary embolus should be definitelyruled out by pulmonary arteriogram. on hospital day number two thepatient underwent a pa gram which revealed a mean ra pressure of 7mm of mercury , a mean rv pressure of 12 mm of mercury , and nofilling defects to suggest a pulmonary embolus. at this point thepatient's heparin was discontinued. the day prior to obtaining thepulmonary arteriogram the patient had a good pa and lateral film ,which revealed no focal infiltrates and no effusions. on hospitalday number three the patient underwent an echocardiogram whichrevealed normal left ventricular size and mild left ventricularhypertrophy with vigorous function and no regional wall motionabnormalities. she had no pericardial thickening or pericardialeffusion to suggest pericarditis. she had structurally normalcardiac valves , no significant mitral or tricuspid regurge. shehad a minimal amount of aortic regurgitation and normal right heartsize and function. at this point , given the fact that the patientwas not felt to have a myocardial infarction , given her low mbtotal ck ratio , and also that she was not felt to have a pulmonaryembolus , given the negative pa gram , the diagnosis of pleurisysecondary to possible close viral syndrome was considered. thepatient was started on naprosyn at 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. on hospitalday number three , to which she responded quite well. afterdiscussion with the patient's primary doctor it was felt that ,given the fact that serious causes for pleuritic chest pain hadbeen ruled out , the patient's management could be followed in anoutpatient setting. on hospital day number four it was felt thatshe was safe to be discharged to home. operations and proceduresperformed during this hospitalization were pulmonary arteriogram bypa hospital on april , 1994. there were no complications.disposition: medications on discharge: discharge medicationsinclude naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. with meals. thepatient is being discharged to home. follow up: she will followup with dr. owen albertine on august , 1994 at 1:30 p.m.dictated by: rudy ezzo , m.d. xr88attending: britt

st changes in i , ii , and v1 through v5. chestx-ray showed stable cardiomegaly.hospital course by systems:1. cardiovascular: the patient ruled out for mi. he had nocomplaints of chest pain at any time during his admission.initially , his lasix and lisinopril were held in the context ofconcern over possible hypotension as an etiology of his episodeof weakness. however , these were restarted on the secondhospital day at slightly diminished doses compared to hisbaseline.2. renal: the patient's creatinine improved and at the time ofdischarge , it was back to his baseline of 1.5.3. endocrine: the patient's diabetes mellitus is very poorlycontrolled. at present , his hemoglobin a1c measured at admissionwas 11.4 indicating an average blood glucose level of greaterthan 300. while in-house , he continued to receive his baselinedose of glipizide xl , however , he was also covered with regularinsulin on a sliding scale. the patient has no prior history ofinsulin use at home. after consideration of the risks andbenefits of other oral agents including the high nature of hishemoglobin a1c , it was decided that insulin therapy would benecessary for adequate control of his diabetes. various concernover the patient's ability to successfully manage insulin therapyat home and so , a simply regimen was selected. to begin with , hewas discharged on standing dose of 6 units of nph in the morningand 6 units at bedtime to be given via a prefilled disposableinsulin pen that will involve no need to draw up the medicationhimself , but simply to select the correct dose and give theinjection.4. neuro: the patient's episode of blurred vision did notrecur. it is possible that his hyperglycemia accounted for this.he did have an ophthalmologic exam one week prior to admissionthat revealed no problems. he had no other neurologic or visualsymptoms during his stay in the hospital.5. fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition: the patient was somewhathyperkalemic at admission with a potassium of 5.3. this resolvedwith a single dose of kayexalate and his potassium returned tonormal levels. the patient was discharged in stable condition on6/19/04 .  to receive close followup , he

coronaryartery disease; hypertension; atrial fibrillation; diabetes type2; end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis; history of urinarytract infections; and benign prostatic hypertrophy.operations and procedures: no operations or procedures weredone.treatments: no treatments were done.review of systems: in addition to what is noted below , he doesnote increased fatigue. no fevers , chills , or night sweats. nopalpitations. no diaphoresis. no abdominal pain. occasionaldiarrhea with loss of bowel control. no nausea or vomiting. nodysuria. no hematuria. no bright red blood per rectum.chief complaint: shortness of breath and failure to thrive.brief hospital course: this is a 73-year-old gentleman withend-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis , with ischemiccardiomyopathy with an ef of 15% who was treated for c. difficilecolitis and worsening chf. the patient has a long history ofesrd secondary to hypertension and diabetes. he beganhemodialysis in january 2005. he also has a long history ofperipheral vascular disease status post right carotidendarterectomy and bilateral external iliac angioplasty as wellas atrial fibrillation and a history of cva diagnosed by mri withthe timing unknown , thought to be secondary to thrombi from hisatrial fibrillation. this gentleman presented with worseningshortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion as well as worseningdysphagia and anorexia on january , 2005. apparently , he was ingood health or at least his usual state of health until april ,2005 , when he was admitted to aton norran rehabilitation hospital of for gusymptoms which are unclear and a loss of appetite. he stayedthere for 30 days and then transferred to a rehabilitationcenter. after being discharged there for 1 week , he developedworsening shortness of breath and was unable to answer the doorwhen his neighbor knocked. the neighbor brought him into the edon january , 2005 , for acute shortness of breath , which thepatient described , has worsened over the past 3 to 4 days. hehas gone from being able to walk across his apartment to now onlybeing able to take 3 to 4 steps before becoming progressivelyshort of breath , and he now sleeps on three pillows. in fact , hecurrently cannot even get through his hpi without 3- to 5-worddyspnea. he denies any pnd. concerning for his dysphagia , hefeels like he first lost weight when he was trying to control hisvolume status prior to hemodialysis initiation in early january2005. his goal was to be 114 pounds and he limited his intake inorder to maintain that weight instead of limiting his volume.about 2 months ago , he began losing his appetite. he states thatthis was because of the ""his renal diet."" it was unclear if thediet caused this loss of appetite or his loss of appetite wasprior to the diet. over the past 3 weeks , he has notedprogressive difficulty in swallowing solid foods. he is able toswallow liquids. since discharge from rehabilitation a weekprior to admission , he is only able to take liquids. he quoteshe cannot even take noodles and soup. he has no nausea orvomiting unless attempting to swallow solids and no abdominalpain. his throat is sore and dry. he constantly wants water andice. also concerning is the report , it is unclear , about a 20-to 40-pound weight loss over the past 2 to 3 months. in the ed ,he was afebrile; heart rate 105; blood pressure 136/70;respirations 18; and 97% on room air. he was given lopressor forrate control for his atrial fibrillation. his ekg showed new twave inversions in the inferolateral leads and q waves , whichwere new for his baseline in the inferior leads. there was alsoan s1 , q3 , t3 , which was new but absent once his rate wascontrolled.the patient was admitted to the floor and briefly transferred tothe unit for refractory hypertension , though he was found to haveright subclavian stenosis and blood pressure was checked in theleft arm. his blood pressure was fine at 100 to 110 systolic.he was then transferred back to the floor. an abdominal ct wasdone on september , 2005 , which showed marked edematous colonicwall beginning on the ascending colon all the way through to therectum. the differential diagnosis at this time waspseudomembranous colitis versus ischemic bowel. his lactatelevel was normal. he had a benign examination , and because ofthe distribution and the past antibiotic use , it was felt that hemost likely had c. difficile , which was found to be culturepositive on august , 2005. he had an echocardiogram , whichrevealed an ef of 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and akinesisas compared to an echocardiogram done at the outside hospital injanuary 2005 with an ef of 30% to 35%. he had severe tr. on july , 2005 , while on hemodialysis , he had an episode of substernalchest pain. enzymes were sent and troponin peaked at 18. an ekgshowed st depressions in v2 through v6 , which resolved with ratecontrol. he received aspirin and heparin and continued hislopressor and statin. the decision was made not to catheterize ,as he was a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel diseaseand not a surgical candidate. the patient made the decision withthe cardiologist , family , and the team. the patient wasscheduled for an egd and colonscopy to evaluate his dysphagia andcolitis , but this was deferred secondary to the incident of thenon-st-elevation mi on january , 2005. subsequently , the patientwas managed medically for his worsening chf and shortness ofbreath with fluid removal at hemodialysis on tuesdays , thursdays ,and saturdays. the patient began flagyl p.o. 500 mg t.i.d. onjanuary , 2005 , which should be continued through august ,2005 , for a full 14-day course.impression: this is a 73-year-old man with acute worseningshortness of breath in the setting of a 20-plus-pound weightloss , increasing dysphagia , and progressive fatigue for the past2 months. he was found to have clostridium difficile colitis andischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. hiscourse was complicated by non-st-elevation myocardial infarctionon january , 2005 , with a troponin peak of 18 , which was likelydemand ischemia from tachycardia in the congestive heart failuresetting. his egd and colonscopy was postponed secondary to thenon-st-elevation myocardial infarction. the patient was managedmedically with fluid removal with hemodialysis for congestiveheart failure. he continues flagyl p.o. for clostridiumdifficile treatment. he was transferred on july , 2005 , to arehabilitation facility.problems by systems:1. gastrointestinal: we are treating his c. difficile colitiswith p.o. flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. from january , 2005 , throughjuly , 2005. his stool did grow out staphylococcus aureus ,but this was likely from colonization from his mouth flora , andtherefore , we are not treating. per id consult , we are holdingall other antibiotics and treating only when cultures arepositive. he had a planned egd and colonscopy , which waspostponed due to the nstemi on january , 2005. he should have ascope done , both upper and lower , 2 to 3 months down the roadonce the patient is stable. his lfts were noted to bump onjuly , 2005 , but now are trending down; that is likelysecondary to either shock liver or just his nstemi. continue tomonitor them at rehabilitation. the patient is unable to swallowsolids and is currently on a full liquid diet. after egd ,consider barium swallow if nondiagnostic. the patient refuses ngtube , so encourage p.o. intake. he will take nepro if asked. heshould have at least 100 cc of nepro a day.2. cardiovascular: chf with an ef of 10% to 15% with globalhypokinesis compared to january 2005 ef of 30% to 35%. he hassevere mr and tr. he is on lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. and captopril12.5 t.i.d. with blood pressure tolerating well. he was startedon digoxin 0.25 three days a week on sunday , wednesday , andfriday , and his current digoxin level is 0.9 on july , 2005.he was wet on examination routinely and so it was taken offbetween 1 to 3 liters at hemodialysis regularly. he had annstemi on january , 2005 , with troponin peak of 18 , likely demandischemia from chf. continue aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin.we discontinued the heparin after 24 hours. a decision was madenot to catheterize , as he is a poor candidate likely to havethree-vessel disease. ekg currently shows q waves inferiorlywith st depressions in v3 through v4 and t wave inversions in v3through v6. the depressions improved with rate control. he doeshave a low blood pressure in the right upper extremity , which isfalse due to a right subclavian stenosis; always check bloodpressures in the left arm. he has atrial fibrillation and heused to be on diltiazem for rate control. he was on lopressorwith good effect. he was restarted on his coumadin dose at 4 mgq.h.s. on july , 2005 , for anticoagulation. he is ontelemetry. he should be monitored of his inr for a goal inr of 2to 3 for his atrial fibrillation and change of coumadin asaccordingly.3. endocrine: now on half-strength novolog sliding scale. hehas had trouble with hyperglycemia for the past several days.his fingersticks can go up to 250. we think this is okay not tocover , as when we choose to cover him , he dips down into the 40s.4. pulmonary: on admission , he had acute shortness of breathand tachycardia. an ekg showed s1 , q3 , t3. pe ct was negative.there was no parenchymal disease. some hilar lymph nodes werenoted. his repeated chest x-rays were every other day , whichonly showed changes in the chf status. there was routinely noconsolidation or interstitial disease seen. his last chest x-rayshowed bilateral pulmonary edema and that was on july , 2005.5. infectious disease: we are only doing flagyl p.o. for c.difficile treatment. he should continue 500 mg t.i.d. p.o.through august , 2005 , holding all other antibiotics. wequestioned if he is septic when his temperatures drop to 95 to96 , but all blood , sputum , and urine cultures have been no growthto date. you could consider a third generation cephalosporin ifa pneumonia develops.6. renal: hemodialysis on saturday , tuesday , and thursday.7. hematology: he has anemia. panel workup with mixed pictureof iron and chronic anemia. we are repleting his iron withvitamin c. he received 1 unit on october , 2005 , athemodialysis. his current hematocrit is 31. guaiac stools havebeen negative.8. he has a malignancy workup , which has been negative so far.he has a normal tsh , psa , and free psa. no mass is seen onabdominal ct or chest ct.9. prophylaxis: he is on heparin subcutaneously and nexium.10. disposition: he is going to rehabilitation today on february , 2005.11. code status: dnr/dni.12. health care proxy: his brother , son gonzaliz ,167-227-0450.plan to do:1. hemodialysis on tuesdays , thursdays , and saturdays.2. continue flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. from january , 2005 , toaugust , 2005.3. follow inr for goal of 2 to 3 for atrial fibrillation , oncoumadin 4 mg p.o. q.h.s. currently.discharge medications: tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.headache;

a decubitus sacral ulcerwith a vac dressing in place on admission. neurologic exam wassignificant for alert and oriented x3. his cranial nerves wereall intact. he had no focal deficits.hospital course:1. cardiovascular: ischemia: status post cabg and avr. onadmission , we held the patient's anticoagulation for a possiblebiopsy of his kidney. we continued his lopressor at b.i.d.dosing. the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction. hehad four-beat runs of nsvt on the day of admission , which he didnot repeat after repletion of his electrolytes. he had chestpain again on hospital day #3 overnight. he did not have any ekgchanges with his chest. he was given lopressor x1 , he ruled outonce again. the pain that he had developed was thought to belikely incisional and not cardiac. pulmonary exam: the patientdeveloped acute worsening of pulmonary status while in theobservation area at the emergency department on admission onhospital day #1. he had an increasing o2 requirement , worseningpulmonary exam , and a chest x-ray that showed pulmonary edema.he was not diuresing effectively with more than 360 mg with ivlasix , which was administered to him in the emergency department ,so renal was called urgently to see him in observation and he wassent for urgent dialysis. at dialysis , they removed greater than4 liters of fluid and the patient was patient was symptomaticallyimproved. he did continue to have lower extremity edemapost-dialysis and an oxygen requirement of 2 liters nasal cannulato maintain his oxygen saturation. he was given iv lasix 80 mgx1 on hospital day #4 with excellent urine output. his lowerextremity edema improved significantly after hospital day #4.2. renal: on admission , the patient's creatinine was 5.3. itpeaked at 6.6 and trended down to 5.1 with clear signs ofimprovement. on admission , there was no improvement in his urineoutput with large doses of iv lasix , however , and renal wasconsulted to clarify whether this was an acute rejection versusatn from toxic doses of cyclosporin. in the emergencydepartment , he was given one dose of solu-medrol 500 mg , however ,he was found to have elevated cyclosporin levels at 679 , so thiswas thought to be the likely cause of his acute renal failure andhis cyclosporin was temporarily held. since that time , on hishospital day #1 , his cyclosporin levels trended down to the pointat which there were just slightly over 100 on hospital day #3 andcyclosporin was reinitiated at lower doses. he was dialyzed onadmission with removal of 4 liters of fluid , cvm , bk , and ldhwere sent from dialysis. his creatinine improved , so furtherdialysis and biopsy were deemed unnecessary.3. id status: the patient presented with uti on admission.this was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg x1 and then 250 mgq.48h. for a course of seven days. blood cultures grew 4/4gram-negative rods , and the patient was diagnosed with urosepsis.after dialysis , the patient was treated with ceftriaxone 1 gdaily and continued on levofloxacin 250 mg q.4-8h. transplantand infectious disease was consulted who recommended ceftriaxonebe discontinued and the levofloxacin to be continued for twoweeks after discharge with repeat cultures. hsv swap from sacralwound was sent. these repeat cultures and hsv swab were allnegative , and levofloxacin was continued for two weekspostdischarge.4. fen: we held the patient's fluids. we checked his i's ando's on a daily basis with daily weights. his hyperkalemia onadmission was 6.1 , resolved with kayexalate , insulin and d50meds. he was given additional kayexalate when he came up to thefloor and his k resolved , backed down to his normal range. thepatient was kept on a renal and cardiac diet. his albumin andtotal protein were low , so a nutritional consult was called ,which optimized his nutritional status.5. endocrine: the patient had a tight glycemic control on nph16 units q.a.m. and 19 units q.p.m. , novolog 6 units q.a.c. withsliding scale , and the patient's sacral decubitus ulcer had a vacdressing in place on admission. plastics was called to addresshis vac. they took down the vac due to some leakage on admissionand he was treated with 1/4 dakin's solution and wet-to-drydressing t.i.d. on discharge , he continued on the wet-to-drydressings. he will be followed as an outpatient vna , and willhave the vac replaced by the vna as an outpatient. hishematocrit was stable throughout his hospital stay.6. prophylaxis: the patient was kept on nexium throughout hishospital stay and we held his anticoagulation for possiblebiopsy. he will resume his outpatient anticoagulation and inrchecks with his inr follow-up clinic. he was able to leave thefloor for cigarettes , and he signed an agreement suggesting thathe was going to tolerate the risk of leaving the floor for shortperiod of time even while on telemetry.on discharge , his medications included calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o.daily , colace 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,

treated with tpa at netla ainor center .  in january1995 , he was admitted to cerri medical center withsubsternal chest pain. a catheterization , at that time , showed100% left circumflex. he had an angioplasty to 20% residual , whichwas complicated by a small dissection. he had an lv gram withinferior hypokinesis , and he also had an 80% om1 lesion that wasangioplastied to 30% residual. his ejection fraction was 53%. hehas been subsequently followed as an outpatient without recurrenceof his anginal symptoms. approximately six weeks prior toadmission , his vasotec was changed to cozaar and his niacin waschanged to pravachol. at that time , he began having someintermittent substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertion.two weeks prior to admission , he was admitted to an outsidehospital with a complaint of chest pain. he is without currentmyocardial infarction. he had an exercise tolerance test and wasthen discharged. the results of the exercise tolerance test werenot available at the time of admission here. there was a questionof an irregular heartbeat during his exercise and he stopped theprocedure secondary to fatigue. the patient stopped his ownpravachol and he changed from cozaar to vasotec 10 mg q.day , atthat time. as mentioned above , the patient has had increasedfrequency of substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertionover the last six weeks. at 2 a.m. on the day of admission , thepatient experienced a substernal chest pain as a dull ache withoutradiation. he had no other associated symptoms. he does notassociate the pain with any particular level of exertion , that itcan happen sitting still or with activity without any particularpattern. with today's episode , he had climbed two flights ofstairs and then developed this chest pain which lasted for 10-15minutes. it was not relieved with rest or after one to two tabs ofsublingual nitroglycerin. by the time he arrived at the emergencydepartment , his chest pain was gone. in the emergency department ,his systolic blood pressure was noted to be 230 and he was treatedwith nifedipine times one and iv nitroglycerin which brought hisblood pressure down to 140/90 and he was

unstable angina over the past six weeksafter a severe episode of chest pain the day prior to admission ,causing orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. he wasadmitted for evaluation and for control of severe hypertension.hospital course: cardiovascular: the patient's blood pressure wascontrolled nicely initially on iv nitroglycerin. his vasotec wasincreased to 10 mg b.i.d. and then discontinued. he was weaneddown off of the iv nitroglycerin and started on imdur 60 mg p.o.b.i.d. and was also started on losartan , which was tapered up to 75mg p.o. q.day with improved control of his blood pressure. thepatient apparently had a poor reaction to norvasc in the past , sothis medication was not tried.on 1 of september september 1996 , he underwent cardiac catheterization

after discharge from 9 dayadmission. his chest pain is identical to prior episodes occurring duringhis previous admission. he originally presented with 2-3 weeks ofgeneralized weakness with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed withsevere polymyositis ( ck up to 33 , 000 ) during last admission. he was givenivf+bicarb for renal protection from myoglobinuria and became volumeoverloaded , with successful diuresis to euvolemia by the time ofdischarge. he had intermittent cp occurring at night , described asnonradiating over left chest associated with sob. he had persistentlyelevated troponin with no ischemic changes on ekg , and his cp was felt tobe due to myocarditis. he was treated with asa , labetalol , isordil ,ccb , and ativan with improvement. he was started on iv solumedrolwith immediate significant improvement in ck ( down to 10 , 000 ) andtroponin ( 0.64 ). during his 12 hour stay at rehab , he developed cpwith sob occurring at night. he was

pleural effusions , no pe.****hospital course by problem:1. chest pain and shortness of breath. he was re-admitted for nocturnalchest pain while at rehab , and concern for myocardial ischemia. heunderwent cardiac catheterization that showed normal coronary anatomy ,suggesting that the elevated ck-mb and troponin were likely frommyocarditis , as previously suspected. notably , his chest pain was oftenassociated with shortness of breath. it was noted on his prior admissionthat he had pleural effusions from the high volume diuresis intended toprotect his kidneys from myoglobin toxicity , however he had been diuresingwell to lasix. it was thought that his cp and sob might be due to pnd givenhis valvular disease. consequently , his vasoldilatory medications wereswitched to evening dosing , his lasix dose increased , and the head of bedkept elevated at greater than thirty degrees. on the day after admission , hehad one episode of chest pain with shortness of breath , where he indicatedpain in his ruq. a kub was negative , as was a pe protocol ct , and heresponded very well to lasix. he had one further episode of sob at night ,again responsive to lasix and position. he had a repeat echo that showedno progression of his valvular disease from prior admission and equivalentef of 70-75%. he was maintained on aspirin , labetalol , diltiazem , imdur , andativan prn.2. arrhythmias. he was on rate control with calcium channel blockers.he had several noctural few beat runs of nsvt , but no other significantevents.3. rhabdo: he has severe polymyositis causing muscle weakness and elevatedck , with possible contribution from cocaine. so far , the remaining work uphas been negative. preliminary biopx sy shows muscle necrosis andchronic inflammation along with features reminiscent of dermatomyositis. hewas changed back to iv solumedrol on admission , and switched to po solumedrolon discharge. his ck dropped from 15 , 000 on this admission to 10 , 000 , andthen hovered around that dose. rheumatology consult fellow gavin nordman feltthis was a normal pattern under treatment , and that the true extent ofrecovery/impairment will only be known in several weeks to months.diagnosis.4. renal. his cr was maintained at 1.3-1.5 over the course of his admission ,likely related to both renal damage from myoglobinuria and possibly fromover-diureses and pre-renal phsyiology , especially in the context of bun of42. his lasix dose , initially increased on admission due to excellentsymptomatic response with diuresis , was in the process of slow tapering atthe time of discharge in attempt to identify the appropriate outpatientdosing , with goal of maximizing symptomatic resopnse and minimizing prerenalphysiology.5. full codeadditional comments: mr water you were admitted for chest pain , and it was determined bylooking at the anatomy of the vessels supplying your heart that you havenot had a heart attack caused by diminished blood flow to the heart. youdo , however , have an inflammatory condition in which your immune systemattacks and breaks down your muscle. as you know , the recovery processwill be long , and you will need to take medication for it for at leastfour to eight weeks. your rheumatologist , dr zoelle , will coordinate yourmedication and care. you have an appointment with her in two weeks.also , you have disease afflicting the valves of your heart , and you willneed to see a cardiologist. you have an appointment with dr kissi for thisissue. in addition , you have an appointment with your new primary carephysician , dr holverson . please attend all of these appointments , and besure to take all your medications as prescribed. lastly , it cannot beemphasized enough that your health depends on the care you take ofyourself , making sure to stop smoking , stop drinking alcohol , and stoptaking any illicit drugs.please seek medical attention for difficulty breathing , worseningweakness , black or bloody stools , or any other concerns.discharge condition: stableto do/plan:1. myositis. please follow ck , may need additional agent in the long term.per rheumatology , response may take weeks.2. chest pain. his pain is not of ischemic origin. he does have rheumaticheart disease , and appears to have pnd with pain and shortness of breaththat is responsive to lasix , position , and oxygen.3. lasix dosing. he will need to be tapered on lasix , with attempt toidentify the proper dose for symptomatic relief while not making himpre-renal.no dictated summaryentered by: wadding , kieth l. ,

heart failure.2. diabetes mellitus.3. history of cerebrovascular accident.4. asthma.history of present illness: the patient is a 54 year-old womanwith history of dilated cardiomyopathyand estimated ejection fraction of 35 to 40% who presented withlower extremity edema , weakness , fatigue , and syncopal episodes x2. at baseline the patient states that she is able to walk andperform her activities of daily living without symptoms of heartfailure. per patient , about five days prior to admission , shebegan to notice increasing lower extremity edema , rapidly spreadingfrom her calves up to her thighs. she also noted symptoms ofweakness and fatigue. on 9/29/03 the patient reported two syncopalepisodes- the first of which was preceded by dizziness after whichshe lost consciousness after lying down. she awoke and walked toher apartment where she apparently lost consciousness a second timealthough she does not remember having any prodromal symptoms priorto the second episode. the patient was found by her neighbor andtaken to the niry hospital .  at labi straubll hospital ,the patient was treated for heart failure with diuresis with ivlasix. an echocardiogram at the malvfi hospital showed an ejectionfraction of 10 to 15% , 4+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspidregurgitation. the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction andecg showed no ischemic changes. the patient did have one run of11-beat non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. liver functiontests were noted to be elevated. her hepatitis panel wasreportedly negative. the patient was transferred from got

cardiovascular: the patient has a dilatedcardiomyopathy and was admitted with volumeoverload. the patient was diuresed with iv lasix throughout herhospital course with successful diuresis of 1 to 2 liters of fluidper day. an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 to25% , severe global hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , andmoderate tricuspid regurgitation. right and left heartcatheterization was performed. the right heart catheterizationshowed the following: right atrial pressure was 8 , rightventricular pressure 35/5 , pa pressure 37/17 , and wedge pressure of15. the left heart catheterization showed two vessel coronaryartery disease , no obstructive lesions. the patient showed markedclinical improvement with diuresis with iv lasix. prior todischarge the lasix was changed from iv to p.o. and the patient wasstable on p.o. regimen of lasix prior to discharge. the left heartcatheterization , as noted above showed moderate coronary arterydisease. the patient was continued on statin for this reason. thepatient had had two syncopal episodes prior to admission along witha run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia at the outsidehospital. this raised the concern along with her low ejectionfraction that she could be having arrhythmias causing syncope. ontelemetry during this admission , the patient was noted to haveadditional runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia along withan episode of complete heart block. the electrophysiology servicewas consulted and placed an icd and pacer on 11/25/03 .  thisprocedure was well tolerated.renal: the

cardiomyopathy service , dr. jim gerardot ,attending , began following patient on the firsthospital day. it was felt that the lasix drip was ineffective andrecommended starting 200 mg iv lasix t.i.d. with the goal ofkeeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. thepatient had difficulty with repletion of potassium during theentire hospital stay. patient does not tolerate well either theimmediate release oral form of potassium or the iv form. the ivform hurts the iv site and the oral form makes him nauseous , but hestill prefers the oral form. over the course of the admission , 10mg p.o. twice daily of slow released potassium was started and ,eventually , was 30 mg twice daily at the end of his stay.captopril was added to the regimen at 12.5 mg three times a day onthe second hospital day and was eventually raised to 50 mg threetimes a day as his blood pressure tolerated , which took four days.creatinine remained stable throughout admission and did not affectour ability to diurese with lasix. after six days , the patient wasadequately diuresed. jvp was now not visible. lungs were clear.there was no edema. the patient is tolerating captopril well.coumadin , which had been 4 mg per day on admission , was cut to 2 mgper day because of the high inr on admission. two days prior todischarge , inr fell to 1.9. patient was restarted on 4 mg per day.at discharge , inr was 1.7. patient does not wish to stay to haveinr corrected. vna has been arranged to administer lovenox and tocheck pt , ptt over the next few days until this normalizes to atherapeutic level.discharge medications: captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125mg p.o. q.d. , lasix 160 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.d. , compazine 10mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.patient

10/16/2004attending: milford wizwer m.d.history of present illness:this is a 36-year-old man with a history of a familialcardiomyopathy , ejection fraction estimated at around 15% withmarked left and right chamber enlargement , severe mitralregurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and pa pressures of 51plus right atrium , as per an echo in 2003. he was also statuspost icd placement in 2001. at baseline , he has a one staircaseexercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. he alsoadmits that he has been having increasing orthopnea andparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. he denies , chest pain ,palpitations , or peripheral edema. he also has a history ofdietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading toheart failure exacerbations. currently , he states that he hasbeen eating ""salty foods , "" and has been drinking a lot of extrafluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always takinghis medications. consequently , he has noticed a worsening in hisexercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably anincrease in abdominal girth. because of these symptomsconsistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicianssuggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management ofhis decompensated heart failure. of note , he has been previouslyon a transplant list , but has been delisted given hisnoncompliance and continuation of tobacco use.past medical history:in addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiencywith the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times.medications on admission:aldactone 25 mg once a day , k-dur 40 meq once a day , lisinopril2.5 mg once a day , isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125once a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. forvolume overload.social history:as mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes ,occasional alcohol use , no iv drug use.family history:his mother , his brother , and his cousin and nephew all have thefamilial cardiomyopathy.physical examination:on the day of admission , he presented with the jvp in the 18 to20 range on the physical examination with positive hjr. hiscardiac exam had a positive s3 of laterally displaced pmi withthe right ventricular heave. he also had a 2/6 systolic murmur.his abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites andpalpable liver edge. his extremities were warm without edema.hospital course:from the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diuresehim iv torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. however , he did not respond wellenough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip withzaroxolyn p.r.n. we also stopped his isordil and ace inhibitorearly on because of blood pressures in the 80s. on admission ,his creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to starta low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. however , his urineoutput was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increasedthe lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mgiv lasix bolus. on this combination of the lasix drip at 20 anhour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very goodand effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day ,negative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in withadmission weight of around 90 kg. on each day , he diuresed aboutan half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point ,he was less than 86 kg. we monitored strict i's and o's , checkeddaily weight. during the course of his diuresis , his sodiumlevels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking alot of free water. the combination of free water intake in thesetting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of hishyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventuallyto 122. we strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intaketo less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodiumlevels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day ofdischarge. we monitored the b.i.d. lytes. eventually , his bloodpressures remained stable. his jvp decreased from 18 to 20 onadmission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urineoutput , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the lasixdrip for one more day. we then discontinued the lasix drip andtransitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , whichwas his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. hecontinued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day ofdischarge , his i's and o's were finally about 500 cc negative ,which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. hisjvp was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. were-added his isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours andhis blood pressures were stable in the 90s. given his potassium ,which was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decidedto increase his aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given hisunderlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standingk-dur from 40 meq a day to 20 meq a day. an echo was done , whichshowed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ mr. they did notcomment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. however , heis a candidate for bi-v pacing given his mildly widened qrscomplex stage iii heart failure and having been on a very goodheart failure regimen up until this point.discharge medications:at discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mgonce a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. ,isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and k-dur 20 meq. we also added folate 5mg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level.he also takes ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia.disposition:he is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with dr.grassi in her thyroid clinic on 3/1/05 .  he has been again urgedto stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because heis a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , heis not listed given the aforementioned reasons. overall , mr.plagmann states that his symptoms have drastically improved. heno longer has orthopnea. he is able to exert himself much morewithout symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , andhe is eager to go homeescription document: 1-0474396 emssten teldictated by: burk , marianoattending: miricle , brendandictation id 5597826d: 6/19/04t: 6/19/04",0

course: in summary , this is a 73-year-old man withextensive coronary artery disease , who presents with one day of histypical anginal pain , multiple bruits , new lateral t waveinversions , admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction. hishospital course by issue:1. cardiovascular: mr. jinkerson was catheterized on the evening ofadmission , and he was found to have the following. he was found tohave a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one was 100 percentoccluded. saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending arterywas open. his left main was 30 percent occluded. his leftanterior descending artery was 99 percent occluded. his diagonalone was 100 percent occluded. his left circumflex was 80 percentoccluded. his left subclavian which was supplying his leftinternal mammary artery

mr. maheu tolerated thisprocedure well. he had no return of his chest pain after theprocedure , and his pulses remained normal , he had no groinhematoma. he was placed on plavix. he also continued his aspirin ,and his coumadin was restarted after the heparin and intravenoustng which were originally put on board to prevent arterial spasmafter the procedure , were discontinued. his next cardiovascularissue was his blood pressure. he was originally on atenolol 25milligrams q.d. , we added back cozaar 25 milligrams q.d. which hehad been on before admission and had been stopped a month priorbecause he had low blood pressure with a systolic in the 80s.however , his first day here , his systolic pressure was 120 to 130 ,and restarted it. he had no problems with that. his bloodpressure a few days after admission was in the 150 to 160 systolicover 70 , and amlodipine was added to his regimen. he was continuedon his outpatient doses of lasix 160 milligrams q.a.m. andmitozalone 5 q.d. he ruled out for a myocardial infarction.2. renal: after the first catheterization , mr. ong creatininewent from 1.3 to 1.8. however , it went back to 1.3 the next day.after the second catheterization it went up to a peak of 4.3.however , his urine output remained at 100 to 150 cc an hour withlasix 100 milligrams intravenous p.r.n. , in addition to his morningdose of 160 milligrams q.a.m. , and he was given normal salineintravenous fluids to equalize his ins and outs. he did not haveany signs of cholesterol emboli , no levator reticularis , noeosinophilia , no blue toes.3. fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: he had a low potassium on themorning of admission with a potassium of 2.7 because he had missedhis outpatient k-dur of 60 meq q.d. he had no symptoms , he had noelectrocardiogram changes. he was repleted throughout admissionand was kept on his outpatient dose of k-dur and had no problemsfurther with potassium. in addition , he was discharged on astanding dose of magnesium because his magnesium was routinely lowthroughout admission , on the order of 1.5 to 1.8.4. hematology: on the day after his catheterization , hishematocrit dropped from 33.0 to 28.0. he was transfused two unitswith an appropriate bump back to 33.0. he tolerated this withoutany problems.5. diabetes: he was maintained on his outpatient regimen of nph30/10 and 4 regular q.p.m. , and rezulin. his blood sugars weremaintained throughout admission.6. genitourinary: he was maintained on his finasteride for benignprostatic hypertrophy. in addition , he had a biopsy prior toadmission which had shown chronic prostatitis. his outpatienturologist had recommended ciprofloxacin 500 milligrams b.i.d. forthirty days. since the hospital does not carry ciprofloxacin , weput him on levofloxacin 500 milligrams q.d. he had no return ofthose symptoms.7. musculoskeletal: on hospital day number four , he developedexcruciating point tenderness in the medial aspect of his rightknee. the knee did not appear swollen or red , and he had no sourceof trauma. however , it was thought it might be a recrudescence ofhis gout. the next day it was more warm and slightly swollen.colchicine helped somewhat , and he was then put on a prednisonetaper starting at 40 milligrams and tolerated this well.disposition: he was discharged to home in stable condition onoctober , 1999. he has follow-up appointments

ventricular pacing at a rate of 77.chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrates or effusions.hospital course: the patient was admitted to the medical intensivecare unit for further treatment evaluation of hissevere metabolic abnormalities. he also by labs he had asignificant severe pancreatitis and was felt to be either a dka orhhnka. an endocrine consult was obtained and they felt that thepatient was likely not in dka as the patient's level ofbetahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 was not enought to explain thepatient's gap or all his metabolic disturbances. the endocrineservice that more likely the patient had hyperglycemic ,hyperosmolar , nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis.initial screens for the cause of pancreatitis were negativeincluding stones. the patient has significant alcohol history andhas been drinking alcohol which is the most likely cause of hissevere pancreatic insufficiency. the patient was aggressivelyhydrated with iv fluids and his metabolic abnormalities began tocorrect. he was also noted by labs to be in acute renal failureand a renal consult was obtained. the patient's nonoliguric renalfailure was in the setting of severe dehydration secondary tohyperosmolar state and ace inhibitors were felt most likely due toatn. a renal ultrasound performed on 1 of july showed no evidence ofgallstones or biliary duct dilatation.an abdominal ct performed on 7 of july showed grade i pancreatitis withno evidence of a pseudocyst. the patient's clinical course wascomplicated by rhabdomyolysis which was felt to be due to ahypophosphatemic state , but this was not completely clear as thepatient's cks began to rise while the patient's phosphate was stillsecondary to the acute renal failure. the patient's cks peakedaround 10 , 000 and then began to fall steadily and the patient'srenal function with continued hydration improved steadily as hiscreatinine and bun returned to normal. however , in the night of20 of june the patient's abdominal pain worsened and there was aquestion of peritoneal signs which prompted an emergent exploratorylaparotomy to rule out abdominal ischemia. however , the findingswere not consistent with ischemic bowel , but only severepancreatitis was noted. on 25 of july and 20 of june the patient did very wellpostoperatively back in the medical intensive care unit. he wasstarted on tpn and with a slow wean of his of dextrose , his bloodsugars normalized. on 20 of june the patient's renal function had alsonormalized. the patient by 5 of september had marked decreased abdominalpain , normalized electrolytes and his renal function was at hisbaseline with a creatinine of 1.0.the patient was transferred out of the medical intensive care unitto our service on 8 of may on tpn and the following medications:1. digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.2. carafate one gram b.i.d.3. albuterol two puffs t.i.d.4. aspirin 325 mg q.d.he is also on tpn , but was being advanced to a clear liquid dietand seemed to be tolerating it well. he also continued to requirea large amount of insulin through his tpn and also through hissliding scale. the patient did well and was able to tolerate aclear liquid diet and was advanced in the next two days to a soft ,solid diet with very low fat.i will dictate the rest of the patient's events , assessment andplan by problem list as follows:1. gi:i. severe pancreatitis: the patient was able to be advancedto a soft solid diet for the past few days. she has abdominal painwhich had almost resolved and then resumed and the patientdeveloped a watery diarrhea. it was felt that this could be due topancreatic insufficiency versus c. diff colitis and therefore c.diff samples were sent and the patient was presumptively started onflagyl and pancrease 12 , 000 units t.i.d. 1/2 hour before meals.the patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea persisted. this promptedus to make the patient n.p.o. once more and another abdominal ctwas obtained. an abdominal ct performed on 30 of march showedprogression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory changes.there was no necrosis or pseudocyst formation noted. also notedwas some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence ofobstruction. therefore , the patient was continued to be keptn.p.o. and tpn was restarted on 25 of april .  the patient has toleratedthis well and at this time has no longer had any abdominal paineither subjectively or on exam. it does occasionally have mild lowback pain which is thought to actually be due to his pancreatitisas opposed to any musculoskeletal cause.ii. diarrhea: the patient also had diarrhea as noted above.he has been worked up extensively. his diarrhea has now resolved.he was c. diff negative , but was treated presumptively with flagylfor seven days. all stool studies including shigella , salmonella ,campylobacter , ova and parasites , microsporidia have been negative.his stool has been sent for quantitative fecal fast which is stillpending on discharge. he has been repeatedly guaiac negative. asnoted above his diarrhea has resolved.iii. resolved heme positivity: the patient earlier in thecourse of his intensive care unit stay had some stools that wereheme positive. they were thought to be due to gastritis. he hasnow been on initially , after that has been on prilosec and nowchanged over to ranitidine in his tpn and has had multiple guaiacnegative stools in the past ten days.iv. small perianal ulcer: the patient was noted to have asmall perianal ulcer. it is felt to be secondary to pressure fromlying in bed and also secondary to his multiple episodes ofdiarrhea which had been going on for days. it is felt that thisshould resolve. if it does not , it is suggested that the ulcer beswabbed and sent for hsv.2. endocrine:i. insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: due to the patient'spancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic.the patient has been followed by the endocrine service and is nowreceiving 45 units of insulin per liter through his tpn. he isalso on a sliding scale regular regimen with finger stick q6h. itis felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him atthis time. as the patient is weaned off his tpn and starts to takep.o. again , he should be switched over to nph b.i.d. with regularinsulin checks on a sliding scale before his meals. the patientalso has a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in threeweeks as noted below.3. cardiovascular: the patient does have a history of congestiveheart failure and has had mild bi-basilar crackles throughout hisstay here. this has not limited him in any way. he has had a goodoxygen saturations. the patient continues to take 40 mg of lasixp.o. q.d. on the day of discharge , he received an extra 20 mg ivas he has been i&os positive for the last few days and we noted aslightly more crackles on his exam. of note , the patient has along history of having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but had beendoing relatively well here. his current medical regimen includesisordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. both ofthese can be titrated upwards as his blood pressure allows. he hashad some labile blood pressures ranging anywhere from the systolicsof 80s to 130s while in the hospital and he has never beensymptomatic and even when he has been , he has had blood pressuresin the 80s and has tolerated this well. he is also maintained ondigoxin 0.375 mg q.d. he is also taking aspirin for his cardiacregimen.4. pulmonary: the patient had good o2 saturations and usuallyranging from 95 to 97% on room air and has had no pulmonaryproblems. he has had bibasilar crackles on exam which is felt tobe due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he is takinglasix. he may need some extra doses of lasix per your directionsthe next few days.5. heme: the patient's hematocrit has been low in the high 20s ontwo occasions. in both cases always drifting down slowly thoughtto be due to delutional effects plus repeat a phlebotomy. he hasbeen transfused a total of three units while he has been in thehospital here. otherwise is hematocrit has been stable formultiple days so has his platelets. also of note the patient hasbeen heme negative from below for more than ten days.6. renal: the patient says his baseline creatinine in which hisacute renal failure has resolved.7. rhabdomyolysis: this has also resolved with the patient's ckshaving normalized over a week ago.8. infectious disease: the patient has remained afebrile , normalwhite count for many days. while here he was also presumptivelytreated for c. diff which was actually found to be negative on hisstool examinations with no fecal leukocytes. the patient'stemperature curve should be followed given that the patientcontinues to have pancreatitis and is at risk for developing aphlegmon.assessment and plan:1. severe pancreatitis: the patient continues to be on tpn. apicc line has been placed and a triple lumen catheter will beremoved prior to transfer of the patient. it is our feeling thatthe patient should remain on tpn for the next two days and then asper your directions , the patient could be slowly advanced on a p.o.diet as tolerated. we feel that the patient deserves another trialto see if he can tolerate p.o. before any long term decisions ismade regarding his nutrition and perhaps placement of a j-tube forlong term feeding. the patient's amylase and lipase on the day ofdischarge are 47 for amylase and 166 for lipase. these valuescontinue to remain low even when the patient was having abdominalpain. this is felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas.a gi consult was also obtained which agrees with this assessment.it is felt that when the patient does start taking p.o. again heshould have pancreas at least 8 to 12 , 000 units t.i.d. half hourbefore meals due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. alsothe patient should be followed clinically very closely includinghis white count , fever curve and his abdominal exam for any signsand symptoms of development of an infection or phlegmon orpseudocyst because of his pancreatitis. the patient's tpn shouldbe continued as noted below.2. endocrine insufficiency: the patient , as noted above , willrequire insulin , both through is tpn and his fingersticks should bechecked every six hours. as noted when the patient is switchedover to a p.o. regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendationsthat nph be given b.i.d. and the patient should be covered with aninsulin sliding scale at bedtime.the patient is being transferred to redist nalereamer memorial hospital on2 of april in good condition. the patient today denies any abdominalpain , nausea or vomiting , but occasionally continues to have mildback pain. his diarrhea has resolved. he is afebrile with a bloodpressure of 120/70 , pulse is 69 , respiratory rate 16 , sat 97 onroom air , with a weight of 69.0 kg. he is comfortable and has hadbibasilar crackles of 1/4 the way up. his abdomen is soft ,nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds. hisextremities are without edema.on the day of discharge his white count is 8.8 , hematocrit is 36 ,addplatelets of 348. his sma-7 was within normal limits with acreatinine of 0.6. his amylase is 47 and his lipase is 160.disposition: the patient is being discharged in good conditionto lakesfic hospital medical center .  his primary carephysician dr. littmann is aware of the patient's discharge and willcontinue to follow with his care. the patient also has anappointment with dr. sanislo in the diabetes clinic at longa ent no on 7 of january at 11 a.m.discharge medications:1. aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.2. albuterol inhalers two puffs q.i.d.3. digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.4. lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.5. captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.6. isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.7. magnesium and potassium sliding scale through ivs while beinghere.diet: the patient should remain n.p.o. for the next two days. histpn orders upon

o. maulding , m.d.admission diagnoses: 1. cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology.2. retrosternal chest pain for rule outmyocardial infarction.3. noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.4. history of pulmonary tuberculosis.chief complaint: mrs. troy burrus is a 54-year-old woman from ston chandseu sa with a background history of idiopathiccardiomyopathy and noninsulin-dependent diabetes , and pulmonarytuberculosis who presented with an 20 minute episode of chest painand dyspnea for a rule out myocardial infarction.past medical history: past medical history is remarkable for 1 ) acardiomyopathy of 10 years' duration ofunknown etiology. the patient denies alcohol abuse. there is nohistory of rheumatic fevers in childhood. there is no valvulardefects , and has no known risk factors for coronary artery disease ,aside from her noninsulin-dependent diabetes. the etiology at thispoint is thought to be viral. the patient experiences intermittentepisodes of mild chest pain and chest pressure with exertionapproximately one episode every 2-3 months and is not currently onsublingual nitrates. she has no known coronary artery disease andhas not had a myocardial infarction. 2 ) noninsulin-dependentdiabetes times three years , well controlled on glucotrol 10 mg p.o.b.i.d. and diabetic diet. she has no known diabetic retinopathy ,nephropathy or peripheral neuropathy. 3 ) the patient has a historyof tuberculosis approximately 20 years ago , diagnosed from a lymphnode biopsy of the left neck. she was treated for one year with acombination of medications. she currently

noted increasingdyspnea and worsening exercisetolerance over the past six months. she was admitted to namen's general hospital under the care of dr. devera in april of 1992 forcongestive heart failure which resolved with diuresis. since thenher baseline exercise tolerance is that she is unable to do a fullload of laundry without getting tired , unable to climb a fullflight of steps without getting tired , but does not experiencechest pain. however , today while walking in her sister-in-law'shouse she experienced severe retrosternal chest pain radiating toher left shoulder and back , which is as great as 10 out of 10 forseverity and lasted for approximately one minute. it was associatedwith dyspnea , sweating and nausea but no vomiting. she alsoexperienced some palpitations. therefore , she had persistent chestpressure and dyspnea on arrival at the amar portraim hospitalemergency room approximately 20 minutes later , at which time thepressure and dyspnea were relieved with two sublingual nitrates.review of systems is remarkable also for chronic cough increasingover the last five months , especially since her capoten dose wasincreased. she denies fever , chills , previous episodes ofpneumonia. of note she was ruled out for active pulmonarytuberculosis during her admission in soba medical center in september 1992.physical examination: on examination on admission , she is apleasant , elderly woman. her vital signsreveal a temperature of 97.4 orally , heart rate of 80 regular ,respiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 108/80 supine with noorthostatic hypertension. o2 saturation was 99% on 4 liters. headand neck examination were unremarkable with no evidence ofadenopathy and a normal thyroid gland. respiratory system showedscattered bibasilar crackles but no focal pathology. cardiovascularsystem showed a heart rate of 80 which was regular at full volumewith occasional ectopic beats. there was no evidence of paradoxicalalternates. jugular venous pressure was elevated to 10 cm abovethe angle of louis' and had a prominent cv wave. all pulses werepresent and equal. the cardiac apex was in the sixth leftintercostal space. midaxillary line was volume overloaded incharacter. no thrills or rubs were appreciated , however , there wasdullness to percussion beyond the apex and an s3 gallop was heardthroughout the precordium. the patient had a soft s1 , a iii/vipansystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating through tothe left axilla. there was also i/vi mvm which could be brought onwith exercise and lying in the left lateral position. a pi murmurwas also heart similar in character to the mi murmur but heard beston the left sternal border and radiating up the neck. there wasalso an ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal border ii/viin intensity and radiating poorly increased with expiration.abdominal examination was soft , nontender , nondistended. there wasa 12 cm hepar which was soft and nonpulsatile. no spring waspalpable. no masses were appreciated. bowel sounds were present ,and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. a well healedsubumbilical midline scar was evident. rectal examination showedno masses , guaiac negative brown stool. bimanual examination wasdeferred at this time. central nervous system examination wasgrossly intact. extremities showed pulses to be presentbilaterally and equal. there was no evidence of deep venousthrombosis and no pedal edema or sacral edema were appreciated.laboratory data: laboratory examinations on admission showed asodium of 136 , potassium 3.4 , blood urea nitrogen16 , creatinine 0.8 , and a glucose of 136. white count was 8.2 witha normal differential. hematocrit was 41.2 and platelets 247. ptand ptt were 13.4 and 29.4 respectively. digoxin level was 2.1.chest x ray showed significant cardiomegaly with dilatation of bothleft and right ventricles but minimal congestive heart failure. theelectrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats per minutewith a complete left bundle branch block and no evidence of acuteischemia. there was no change as compared with electrocardiogramsfrom 2/10 .  the initial cpk was 44.hospital course: in summary then the patient is a 54-year-old womanwith cardiomyopathy , noninsulin-dependentdiabetes , who presented now with an episode of chest pain anddyspnea for rule out myocardial infarction and further evaluation.actively she is in hospital where it as follows: 1 ) cardiomegaly ofunclear etiology: last echo done was in 25 of november by dr. pernin whichshowed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global left and rightventricular dilatation. 2 ) chest pressure and substernal chest painand dyspnea: the patient was placed on the telemetry floor , wasmonitored for 24 hours and a rule out protocol was performed. theck were 44 , 37 , and 34 respectively and there was no evidence ofelectrocardiogram changes on serial electrocardiogram. she did haveone run of 4-beat ventricular tachycardia the first 24 hours ofadmission. potassium was replaced in view of the potassium level of3.4. initial digoxin level was 2.1 and digoxin was held for aperiod of 72 hours. she was continued on her lasix , captopril anda sliding scale nitropaste and was started on one aspirin a day.3 ) noninsulin-dependent diabetes was well controlled on diet andglucotrol and her sugars remained between 100 and 200 throughoutthis admission. 4 ) status post tuberculosis: in view of herprevious tuberculosis status , a ppd was not performed and thepatient was not ruled out for tuberculosis.on review of mrs. ekis 's history and following a rule out for arecent myocardial infarct , it became apparent that her exercisetolerance had diminished dramatically over the past three monthsand that she was already on optimal medications. it was thoughtthat she would benefit from a cardiac transplant evaluation at thispoint and dr. gerathy was kind enough to consult. a transthoracicechocardiogram performed on 2 of may showed once again a dilatedcardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. there was 2+ ofmitral regurgitation with a pulmonary arterial pressure ofapproximately 60. there was also 3+ or pr and evidence ofsignificant left atrial hypertrophy. no ventricular clicks orthrombosis were seen. however , in view of the dilatedcardiomyopathy , the patient was started on coumadin therapy. an etto2 uptake test was performed on 2 of may and the patient performedfor 3.38 minutes on a cycle ergometer. she experienced on chestpain and there were no obvious electrocardiogram changes. the testwas stopped because of shortness of breath. her o2 uptake wascalculated at 11.4 per kick per minute. in addition her capotentherapy was changed from 37.5 q.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. at this pointit became apparent that mrs. stuesse had a significant degree ofcardiac dysfunction. a right-sided catheterization performed on5 of august showed a right atrial pressure of 26 and a pulmonary wedgepressure of 36. it was decided that she would be an excellentcandidate for cardiac transplantation , and a full cardiactransplant workup was initiated. the following tests were sent off ,the results of many of which are still pending: 1 ) one chest x raydetailed above; 2 ) electrocardiogram as detailed; 3 ) urinalysis andsediment which are unremarkable; 4 ) sma-7 with cpk , complete withdifferential , pt , ptt , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , reticulocytecount and bleeding time; 5 ) hla typing and antibody screen whichare pending; 6 ) blood typing; 7 ) dental consult; 8 ) physiotherapyconsult; 9 ) social service consult; 10 ) nutrition consult; 11 )gynecology appointment made as an outpatient and a booking forbilateral mammography was made; 12 ) pulmonary function tests wereperformed; 13 ) noninvasive carotid doppler studies and peripheralarterial noninvasive studies were performed the results of whichare pending; 14 ) echocardiogram as detailed above; 15 ) exercisetest with o2 as detailed above; 16 ) 24-hour urine for creatinineand protein; 17 ) hiv antibody test; 18 ) fasting glucose serumprotein , electrophoresis , cholesterol , triglycerides ,immunoglobulins , hepatitis b and c serology , as well as bloodcultures , sputum cultures and urine cultures were sent; 19 )psychiatric consults , has not been obtained at this point and willbe done as an outpatient; 20 ) virology titers for cytomegalovirus ,ebstein-barr virus , toxoid , measles and varicella zoster were sent;21 ) tft and hemoglobin a1c were sent; and 22 ) right heartcatheterization as detailed above; 23 ) abdominal ultrasound to ruleout gallstones , aortic aneurysm and renal abnormalities were doneand were within normal limits.disposition: at this point the patient will be discharged home in astable but guarded condition. she will be followed bythe cardiology and cardiac surgery departments at the chapstone hospital .  her primary attending dr. mondelli from sontriad university hospitals( telephone number 990 062-8307 ) will be updated as to her program.outstanding consults were be sorted on an outpatient basis and shewill be listed for a cardiac transplant. her discharge medicationsinclude lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d , k-dur 20 meq p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5mg p.o. t.i.d. she will also be sent home on home o2 as required.digoxin will be started at 0.1 mg p.o. q d. pt and ptt levels willbe checked q weekly and the patient's doses changed accordingly.dictated by: rashad f. hamlette ,

debridement and iv antibiotics. he wasinitially evaluated by the cardiology service and endocrineservice. patient was cleared by cardiology for the procedure andwas considered well managed medically in regard to his coronaryartery disease. in regard to patient's diabetes , he was initiallyextremely brittle and requiring extensive fine tuning by theendocrine service who , at the time of discharge , had his bloodsugars repeatedly under 200 , with easily achieved insulin regimen.the patient was taken to the operating room initially on the 13 of june ofapril where he underwent a right third and fifth toe amputationwith wound debridement. at the time of operation , purulentdrainage with necrotic regions of the bases of the third and fifthtoes were found. the wound was left open with packing , withfurther plans for more formal tma after adequate drainage of thefoot. the patient , from the beginning of the hospital course , wasstarted on iv vancomycin , levofloxacin and flagyl which hecontinued throughout his hospital course. the patient toleratedthis initial wound debridement and toe amputation without incident.please see dictated operative report for further details. thepatient

dependent for 13 years , complicated byhemochromatosis , now with gram negative rod bacteremia.history of the present illness: the patient is a 34 year-old womandiagnosed with aplastic anemia 22years ago. the patient never had a potential donor for transplantand was immediately treated with immunosuppressive therapy foraplastic anemia using steroids without efficacy. the patientsuffered complications from steroid use , including avascularnecrosis , resulting in bilateral hip replacements as well aschronic bony damage to her shoulders for which she uses painmedications. for the past 13 year , the patient has remainedtransfusion dependent and requires a few units on packed red bloodcells on an every two week basis and platelet transfusions whenevershe develops epistaxis. in september of 1998 , the patient developeddiabetes mellitus. the patient had already been known to have anelevated ferratin due to blood transfusions from years previously.however , when she had been started on desferal in the past , shedeveloped a port-a-cath infection and ultimately leakage ofdesferal to the surrounding skin , which resulted in extrusion ofher port-a-cath through her skin. she was therefore off desferalfor a number of years. the patient presented in mid september of 1998with a blood glucose in the 500 to 600 range , associated withpolyuria , polydipsia , and a 19 pound weight loss. an abdominal ctscan was performed at that time , which was consistent with ironoverload. the patient's ferratin was noted to be the 7 , 000 range.the patient was begun on insulin therapy and desferal 24 hours aday. a port-a-cath was placed in the patient's left upper chest.the patient's desferal was given at 2 grams per 24 hours. she hada gradual decrease in her insulin requirements by 50%. in april of1998 , the patient went on vacation to wark for two weeks.toward the end of her stay , she developed an infected port-a-cathand was readmitted to the jera counta in earlyapril with a port-a-cath infection. at that time , four out of fourblood cultures grew out staphylococcus aureus. because of concernof the long term sequelae of staphylococcus aureus infection , thepatient was treated with nafcillin for six weeks. the patient didwell on nafcillin with resolution of her fevers. the patient wasreadmitted to the biehay sciencesmot hospital on october , 1998 tojuly , 1998 for a two day history of fevers to 101 associatedwith the development of a painful perirectal abscess. the abscesswas assessed and required surgical drainage after a platelettransfusion to increase the patient's platelets to 42 , 000. thepatient underwent an incision through the imount sheo bona medical center .  byjuly , 1998 , the cultures from her abscess grew gram negativeenteric rods , sensitive to cipro. all of the patient's bloodcultures were negative. speciation of the gram negative rodsrevealed klebsiella pneumonia. the patient was discharged home onciprofloxacin , which she took for an additional ten days afterdischarge. since september , 1998 , the patient had been off allantibiotics and the plan was for licausi to have another set of bloodcultures drawn to document resolution of all infection prior to theconsideration of putting in a new central access , such as ahickman. the patient was seen at the h care healthon the day prior to admission and reported that she had beenentirely afebrile without chills. the patient also noted that herblood sugar was well controlled on a stable regimen of insulin inthe 24 hours after she was seen in the clinic. two out of fourblood cultures that were drawn in the clinic revealed gram negativerods. the patient was therefore asked to return to the do county hospital for treatment of gram negative rod bacteremia.past

insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension , age , andelevated cholesterol , who was admitted to the cardiology serviceafter a syncope in vascular clinic. patient was in her usual stateof health while in vascular clinic , awaiting to discuss the resultsof arterial studies with her vascular surgeon , when she noted toslump over in the chair in the waiting room for about 1-2 minutes.she was unresponsive at the time. a code blue was called. by thetime the code team arrived to the scene , the patient was awake andalert , with a regular pulse. her blood pressure was noted to be inthe 140s. the patient did not recall an aura or a prodrome. shedenied any incontinence and aura or postictal confusion. she wastaken to the emergency department for evaluation , where she wasafebrile , with a heart rate of 96.1 , heart rate of 100 , a pressureof 178/82 , with oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. she wasthen transferred to the floor for further evaluation andmanagement.her past medical history is as follows: 1. coronary arterydisease , status post multiple catheterizations in the past. hermost recent catheterization was in october of 2000 , which showed aproximal rca stenosis of 100% and a distal lad lesion of 40-50%.she was also noted to have luminal irregularities at the om-1 at asite of previous stenting. 2. peripheral vascular disease ,history of chronic ulcers , status

p.o. q. day. the patient has no knowndrug allergies.social history: she lives in arbafontpringsalb o land near her daughter. shespends most of her time at home. she does notsmoke and does not drink alcohol.physical exam on admission: she was afebrile. heart rate was 50and regular. blood pressure was140/80. respiratory rate was 20 , saturation of 98% on room air.she was a pleasant african american woman lying in bed. she hasher right eye closed. she had a surgical right pupil , with a leftcataract. her oropharynx was benign , her mucous membranes weremoist. she had no jugular venous distention. there was a questionof soft bilateral carotid bruits. the lungs revealed decreasedbreath sound at the left apex , but otherwise was clear toauscultation. cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate andrhythm , there were no murmurs appreciated in the emergencydepartment. the abdomen was soft , without hepatosplenomegaly. inthe extremities , there are incisional scars at the medial calves onboth legs , with 1+ dp pulses bilaterally , her legs were warm , andthere was no edema. on neuro exam , she was alert and oriented x 3 ,cranial nerves iii-xii were grossly normal , and her motor exam waswithout focal deficits.laboratories of note: her potassium was 3.8 , her bun was 39 , andher creatinine was 1.9 , her baselinecreatinine being anywhere between 1.7 and 2.0. glucose was 122.her troponin on admission was 0.32 , and of note , back in octobershe had also been admitted and was noted to have a troponin in the.3 range. her ck on this admission was 308 , with an mb fraction of3.9. calcium was 9.2 , magnesium was 2.7 , white blood cell count6.1 , hematocrit 36 , platelets 238. her ua was negative. her ekgshowed normal sinus rhythm at 85 , with left axis deviation ,evidence of lvh , left atrial enlargement , and some t waveflattening in v4 through 6 and t wave inversion in 1 and l. herchest x-ray was without infiltrate or pulmonary arterialcongestion.in summary , this is a 65-year-old woman with vasculopathy andextensive coronary artery disease , who presented with suddensyncope x 1-2 minutes. given the history , the story was veryconcerning for a malignant arrhythmia. she was admitted forfurther workup of ischemic or malignant arrhythmia causes of hersyncope.her hospital course is summarized by systems: 1. cardiovascular:the patient was placed on the monitor and no definitye symptomatic arrhythmiaswere observed. however , because of her demonstrated asymetricallyhypertrophied left ventricle and ergions of inferoposterior scar ,electrophysiology study was recommended ( see below and addendum ).the patient was initially admitted with a troponin of0.32 , which on repeat examination was 0.87. it wasthought to be consistent with a very small non-q-wave mi. she wasstarted on heparin for 48 hours. on 10/30/2002 , the patient had anadenosine mibi , which showed a moderate size lesion ofinferolateral and a small apical region of reversible ischemic.she had a cardiac catheterization on 1/9/2002 , which revealed an80% proximal circumflex lesion which was stented to 0%. she had anechocardiogram performed on 3/10/2002 , which showed a left atrium of 2.9 cm.she had asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy , with preserved overallsystolic function and an ejection fraction estimated to be 60%. this wasthought to be a potential source of focus for ventricular arrhythmias , andfurther supported the decision to go to electrophysiology study.2. pulmonary: one of the considerations entertained to explainthe patient's syncope was a potential pulmonary embolus. thoughshe had not been hypoxic on presentation , the sudden nature of theevent , as well as her tachycardia , was felt to warrant furtherworkup for a pe. she had a d-dimer sent , which came back at >1000.she later had a vq scan which was read as low probability. lowerextremity noninvasive ultrasounds of both legs revealed nothrombus.3. endocrine: the patient has insulin dependent diabetesmellitus. we continued her morning nph dose and covered her withregular insulin sliding scale for the remainder of herhospitalization. her sugars were relatively well controlledthroughout.4. social/psych: the patient has a known difficult homesituation , with previous known problems with her son and otherfamily members. social services was involved. they interviewedthe patient and involved a consult to crest medical .  at thetime of this dictation , that evaluation is still pending.the final disposition of the patient is still pending at this time.i will complete this dictation at the time of discharge , includingthe patient's disposition and disposition medications.dictated by: garry plainy , m.d. wx53attending: darius jez , m.d. ni60

severe mitralregurgitation , posterior leaflet with mitral calcifications andlinear density concerning for endocarditis.hospital course:impression: a 76-year-old female with mitral regurgitation ,history of chf , history of recurrent uti , who presented withnausea and chills , had hypotension requiring a medical icu stay x2 days , with streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitralcalcifications in linear density concerning for endocarditis plusklebsiella uti.1. infectious disease: the patient presented with chills andhypotension and was admitted to the micu from the ed fortreatment of septic shock. her mean arterial pressures were keptabove 65 with levophed. she initially was treated withlevofloxacin and vancomycin to treat gram-positive coccibacteremia and uti. blood culture from 5/15 , grew outstreptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin mic0.19. urine culture was positive for klebsiella , ampicillinresistant , gentamicin and levofloxacin sensitive. on 1/11 ,antibiotics were changed to penicillin 3 million units iv q.4h.and gentamicin 50 mg iv q.8h. atee on 5/29 showed severe mitralregurgitation with posterior leaflet calcifications and lineardensity concerning for endocarditis. therefore , a picc line wasplaced on 10/11 for continuation of a six-week course ofpenicillin 3 million units iv q.4h. until 1/3 and two-weekcourse of gentamicin 50 mg iv q.8h. until 9/12 .  she will followup in the infectious disease clinic with dr. ramiro halcom on1/5/05 at 8 a.m.2. cardiovascular: ischemia: the patient was maintained onaspirin. lipitor was initially helped for an initialtransaminitis presumed to be secondary to shock liver , that atthe time of discharge her liver enzymes had normalized and shewas restarted on her lipitor. pump: the patient has a historyof congestive heart failure , with an ejection fraction 60% in6/8 .  she had hypotension , requiring levophed until 2/5 .  shehad an episode of flash pulmonary edema on 6/16 in the settingof fluid bolus and one unit of packed red blood cells. she has avery attenuatus balance between preload dependence and overload.her lasix and ace-i were held while she was hypotensive. becauseher systolic blood pressure continued to be low in the 90s andlow 100s , attempt was not made to re-add the ace while in thehospital. it is anticipated that her cardiologist and outpatientphysicians will attempt to add the ace back onto her medicalregimen for better afterload reduction as her blood pressuretolerates. the patient also has a very severe mitralregurgitation , which would be one of the reasons that an ace onher medication regimen would be beneficial. rhythm: the patientwas maintained on telemetry , and was found to be a normal sinusrhythm with ectopy , including short once of nonsustainedventricular tachycardia. she was started on lopressor 12.5 mgt.i.d. on 1/11 , and this was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. atdischarge , with her heart rates continuing to be between the 70sand the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy. herelectrolytes were also well repleted.3. gastrointestinal: the patient had evidence of shock liver( 4/10 with an alt of 135 , ast of 177 , alkaline phosphatase of251 , and t bili of 1.7 ) that is now resolving. lipitor was held ,and was started as a transaminitis resolved. non-contrast ct ofthe abdomen showed biliary sludge and gallstones , no evidence ofacute cholecystitis. right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmedthe ct findings. colon cancer is a concern with the patient'sanemia being new since 5/8 .  her last colonoscopy was in 2000 ,and she will benefit from repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient.she was continued on nexium for prophylaxis. heme: the patienthad guaiac positive stools in the medical icu , her hematocrit wasstable around 33%. she has a microcytic anemia with an mcv of79 , her iron studies ( iron of 10 , tibc of 191 , ferritin is 744 )suggesting anemia of chronic disease with possibly overlying irondeficiency.4. endocrine: the patient had a normal random cortisol level of35.3. she had an uncertain diagnosis of diabetes and was on theportland protocol in the medical icu. hemoglobin a1c , however ,was 6.5. therefore , she was maintained thereafter only oninsulin sliding scale and rarely required any coverage.5. prophylaxis: the patient was kept on lovenox and protonix.discharge medications: aspirin 81 mg daily , iron sulfate 325 mgdaily , gentamicin sulfate 50 mg iv q.8h. until 9/12 for atwo-week course , penicillin g potassium 3 million units iv q.4h.until 1/3 for a six-week course , lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. ,caltrate plus d2 tablets p.o. daily , lipitor 10 mg daily , andprotonix 40 mg daily. the patient has not been restarted on herhome lasix and lisinopril secondary to persistently low bloodpressures between the 90s and 100s. it is anticipated thatespecially her lisinopril and her lasix will be added back on toher medical regimen as her blood pressure tolerates. given thatshe was no longer on lasix , she was also taken potassiumchloride.disposition: the patient is to be discharged to rehabilitationat acanmingpeerra virg tantblu medical center in

negative.review of the prehospital ekg demonstrated a complete( third-degree ) heart block. however , ekg done immediately uponadmission to the trauma bay demonstrated a bifascicular block ,with a rate in the 40s.hospital course by systems:1. cardiovascular: he was admitted to the cardiac step-downunit. he had zoll pacer pads were placed upon his chest , andatropine remained at his bedside. he also had an additional zollpacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside ,however , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomaticwith his bifascicular block. he had serial enzymes , which wereperformed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. he wentto the cardiac cath lab , which demonstrated some coronary arterydisease. please see the dictated cardiology reports for thefindings of the cath lab. it was felt , however , this wasunchanged from prior studies. he also went to theelectrophysiology lab. they were unable to induce anyventricular tachycardia or other dysrhythmias during theprolonged ep studies. he had a pacemaker inserted. thepacemaker was followed by the electrophysiology service , and wasfound to be working adequately. the attending was dr. matt duropan ,with the electrophysiology service. dr. caires with thecardiology service saw him and was attending on record.2. neurology: he was seen by the neurology service. so , thiswas under dr. edgardo mccorison , the attending neurologist on thecase. he had an mri/mra performed of his head and neck. thediffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of anyabnormality. there was a region of increase signal intensity onthe t2 and flair images , involving the vasoganglion , extendingthe corona radiata. therefore , given the fact that signal wasseen on the t2 and flair , not on the diffusion-weighted , it wasfelt that this was at least 10 days old. therefore , this was notfelt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehiclecollision. it was most likely represented an old cva , which wasnot previously detected. given the fact that the patientremained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , andradiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10days old , and this was not further addressed. an mra of his headand neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system. themri/mra of the neck was essentially normal , however , the leftbifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis.the right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis ,however , could not be completed excluded. given artifact , thiscould be further followed up with an outpatient venous duplex ofthe carotid arteries.3. musculoskeletal: he was seen by the orthopedic service inthe emergency department at the time of the trauma , he ultimatelyhad an mri that was performed of his knee. this showed tears ofthe medial and lateral menisci. there was no evidence offracture. he remained in a knee immobilizer. he saw physicaltherapy , which felt that further therapy would be indicated.with the impression of the orthopedic service that no acuteintervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with sportsmedicine or orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. in addition ,he was noted to have several rib fractures. the rib fractureswere felt to be the source of his pain , he continue to complainof some inspiratory pain throughout his chest. however , headamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall uponinspiring. it was therefore felt that given the negative enzymesand the negative cath , and the known rib fractures that the chestpain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain. this painwas well controlled with the combination of dilaudid andoxycodone. he was encouraged to take several deep breaths perhour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia.4. infectious disease: there was no evidence of any acuteinfection. of note , his white count was trending upwards , on thelast two days of admission. it was felt that this probablyrepresented stress , given all the recent procedures that weredone , including the catheterization and the electrophysiologystudies , rather than a2 infection. the chest x-ray was performedon the 25th , which demonstrated no infiltrate. this was reviewedwith an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes.otherwise , it was essentially negative. in addition , a repeaturinalysis was performed. the results are pending at the time ofdictation , however , will be followed up prior to the patient'sdischarge from the hospital. the patient appears well , andstates that he is feeling at his best since the accident.however , further workup for his white count is not performed atthe present time , however , the patient is informed , as the no hospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patientseem to develop any evidence of infection that he should bereevaluated by a physician.5. nutrition: the patient is able to eat without anydifficulty. he was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet.6. hypercholesterolemia: he was continued on his zocorthroughout the hospitalization.7. prophylaxis: he was initially treated with lovenox 40 mgsub-q. q. day for a prophylaxis against dvts. he is also onaspirin and plavix for secondary cardiac and neurologicalprophylaxis. the lovenox is discontinued , at the request of theelectrophysiology service on the 24th.8. endocrine: given the numerous contrast studies , initiallyhis metformin was held. however , he was later restarted on this.in addition , he was continued on his glyburide and covered withsliding scale insulin. his blood sugar was never any significantproblem during his hospitalization.9. disposition: the patient will be going to missp medical center , instable condition. at the rehab , he will continue to get physicaltherapy , which he has received in the hospital. it was felt thata short course of rehab would benefit the patient to allow him togo back living independently again. he will be discharged to therehab in stable condition.medications at discharge:1. tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.2. aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.3. atenolol 100 mg

discharge appointments. he hasappointments with dr. jc rizzo , with sports medicine , dr.mac gladwin in 10-14 days , and dr. aldo helger in oneweek. appointment with dr. mittman is in 3 weeks.addendum:mr. flentge had this pacemaker placed and was recoveringuneventfully. however , it was noted that he started havingincreasing white count. it was felt this was perhaps due to amild urine infection and was started on levaquin. however , hestarted the next day complaining increasing pain in his knee. atthis time , his white count had risen to 23 , 000. the knee wasobviously a concern for possible infection. his knee was warm ,was tender and was erythematous , compared to the contralateralside. as a result , the orthopedic service was again consulted.an arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a drytap; no fluid was able to be obtained. the subsequent day , hewas complaining of increasing pain , and the sed rate returned inthe 99 with a crp of 190. the ep service again evaluated thepatient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clearinfection from the pacer site. he continued to have no erythemaor tenderness around the pacer site. his chest x-ray wasessentially unremarkable. the next day ( 10/9/05 ) , he was seenby the rheumatology service , under dr. burris who also felt thiswas most likely to be prepatellar bursitis , probably septic innature , with a hematoma. he was asked to seen by the infectiousdisease service , under dr. ferlic and lou marzinskehe was started on ancef 1 gm q.8h. a picc line will be placedlater today on the 5/15/05 and he will be discharged to rehab.of note , he has been afebrile for more than 48 hours while on theancef , and his white count has improved dramatically , into theapproximately 10000 range. he will continue to get iv ancefq.8h. for an additional 12 days. new consultants on the case ,again dr. hempe and dr. bradford mcguigan with infectiousdisease , dr borde and dr. frances thackston with

palpable femoral pulses and biphasicdopplerable pulses bilaterally , dp and pt. extremities showedbilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration atthe base of the left fourth toe. all toes are exquisitely tenderto palpation. sensation is decreased but equal bilaterally.hospital course: this 75-year-old female vasculopath wasadmitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vasculardisease which was suspected to be contributing to her newulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as anexacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , statuspost coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. she wasplaced on broad-spectrum antibiotics and plan was made for an mrato evaluate her anatomy. unfortunately , the patient was unableto tolerate the mr and did experience some mental status changesthat prevented further noninvasive imaging , when she receivedsome narcotic following her hemodialysis round. over the ensuingdays she required rather significant doses of zyprexa and haldolto contain agitation and delirium , as the patient would also getphysical and violent. this appeared to sedate her sufficientlyand over the following days , she did manage to calm significantlyand returned to her baseline mental status. she did appear veryemotionally labile throughout the rest of her stay and incrediblyremorseful for previous events. on 6/28/2006 , she was offeredan angiogram to delineate aortic and bilateral lower extremityrunoff anatomy. she did tolerate this well under simple ivconscious sedation. this showed chronic disease withcollateralization and very poor inflow to the bilateral feet withessentially one vessel run off on either side. after extensivediscussions with the patient and the patient's family , thepatient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypassgraft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication.please see the operative note for further details. the patientdid tolerate the procedure well. by time of discharge , she wastolerating a regular diet and ambulating at baseline with herrolling walker. the pain was well controlled with minimalanalgesics that were not narcotic based. cardiology wasconsulted during this time to optimize her prior to the or. herprimary cardiologist , dr. fugle did make some recommendationsincluding an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejectionfraction and no wall motion abnormalities. her beta blockade wastitrated up and she was instructed to follow up with cardiology.she did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without unduedifficulty. she did

disease.albinism.history of gout.history of present illness: the patient is a 46 year old koreanmale with a history of coronary arterydisease , who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting andpresented with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the backand arm occurring 7 hours previously. the patient's history of ccoronary artery disease began in 20 of june , when he developed substernalchest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization showing a 100%right coronary artery occlusion and 80% left anterior descendingocclusion , 70% proximal mid-left anterior descending lesion.angioplasty was attempted , but was unsuccessful. in 1 of january , thepatient underwent a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by dr.melsheimer at largdon tar county health with a left internal mammaryartery graft to the left anterior descending and right internalmammary artery graft to the posterior descending artery. however ,the patient had persistent incisional-type pain after his coronaryartery bypass grafting , but reported absence of his angina painpost-cabg. the patient underwent an echocardiogram post-cabgshowing normal left ventricular function with no regional wallmotion abnormalities , moderate effusion and mild left atrialenlargement 4.8 centimeters. the patient did well for 2 yearspost-cabg and underwent an exercise tolerance test in 15 of september ,exercising for 10 minutes and 0 seconds , maximum blood pressure170/100 , without chest pain or electrocardiogram changes ,considered to be a negative test. since then , the patient has onlyhad sharp incisional pain not related to exertion , and he suffersno exertional angina and has no exercise limitation. over the pastseveral months , the patient has gradually developed increasingexertional chest pain , increasing in both intensity and frequency ,to the point where it was occurring daily 1 week prior toadmission. the patient had been tried on multiple medications asan outpatient , however , because of issues ofnoncompliance/alternative belief system , it was unclear as to whatmedications the patient was actually taking. on the day ofadmission at 1:30 pm , the patient experienced severe 8 out of 10substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm with numbness andneck tightness , associated with dizziness and numbness on thescalp. the patient had no nausea , vomiting or shortness of breath ,but did suffer pleuritic pain in addition. the pain lasted 30minutes and was somewhat alleviated with rest and sitting in thesupine position on the way to the emergency room. at the line sumharca center emergency room , the patient had worsening ofthe severity of his pain and was treated with sublingualnitroglycerin without relief , then morphine sulfate 4 milligramstimes 2 , lopressor 5 milligrams times 1 , nitro-paste 1 inch withcomplete relief. an electrocardiogram on admission showed normalsinus rhythm , rate 80 , axis normal , no st or t-wave abnormalities ,no q-waves. the patient was admitted to the prorouge en no team.past medical history was notable for albinism , he denies ulcers orgastrointestinal bleeds , he has a history of gout. habits includedformer heavy alcohol use , however , he denies use in the last 6months. the patient smoked cigarettes until 5 years ago.allergies were no known drug allergies. family history wasnegative. social history revealed the patient is an appliancetechnician , he is married with 3 children. medications onadmission revealed that the patient reported using nifedipine-xl 30milligrams by mouth each day , enteric-coated aspirin 1 per day ,occasional indocin and colchicine. his inca medical center prescription also included lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouthper day , and isordil 20 milligrams by mouth 3 times , but thepatient denied taking these.physical examination: the patient was mildly diaphoretic in noapparent distress. temperature was 97 ,heart rate 78 , blood pressure 140/90 , respiratory rate 20 on 2liters of oxygen with 97% saturation. skin was pale with red hair.oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , pupilswere equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation. carotidswere ii+ bilaterally , there was a sternotomy scar on the chest , noevidence of infection. lungs were clear to auscultation andpercussion without rales. cardiac examination showed a soft s2 , s1was normal , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. abdomen was soft ,nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly. rectal examination showed normaltone , normal prostate , guaiac negative. femoral pulses were i+bilaterally without bruits. extremities showed ii+ pulses in thedorsalis pedis , no edema , the deep tendon reflexes were normal.neurologic examination was nonfocal.laboratory examination: chest x-ray showed clear lungs and nopneumonia or congestive heart failure.the electrocardiogram was as noted above. sodium was 141 ,potassium 4.7 , chloride 112 , bicarbonate 24 , blood

time 33.9 ,creatinine kinase 1 , 010 with 20 myocardial bands , ldh 222.urinalysis was notable for 4+ proteinuria , no white cells , no redcells , 1 to 2 hyaline casts.hospital course: the initial impression was the patient hadprobable coronary disease and probable unstableangina. he was admitted for intensive cardiac monitoring andcardiac catheterization. the patient was started on heparin at1 , 000 units per hour after bolus and sliding scale nitro-paste ,aspirin and lopressor , and continued on nifedipine. on the firstday of admission , the patient suffered 2 episodes of substernalchest pain and he was taken somewhat emergently to cardiaccatheterization which revealed a patent left internal mammaryartery graft to the left anterior descending , a patent rightinternal mammary artery graft except for small vessel disease inthe graft , and an essentially occluded posterior descending artery.the native coronary arteries showed occluded left anteriordescending proximally with filling from the left anteriordescending , circumflex showed a long 70% proximal lesion at thesecond obtuse marginal branch with 90% distal lesion. the rightcoronary artery was occluded proximally with right-to-rightcollaterals and left-to-right collaterals from the left anteriordescending. the patient was planned for a 2-step angioplasty andwas returned to the floor for stabilization while awaiting hisangioplasty. however , the patient suffered 2 episodes ofsubsternal chest pain despite being on intravenous heparin andintravenous nitroglycerin was initiated and the patient wastransferred to the coronary intensive care unit. the patientremained pain-free until he underwent angioplasty of the rightcoronary artery lesions with a result of 20% residual stenosis. ofnote , the patient's creatinine kinase levels continued to trenddownward with the initial creatinine kinase being 1 , 010 being hismaximal value. the patient had no further chest pain after hisangioplasty , except for the baseline incisional pain which wasunrelated to exertion. the patient was monitored closely for 2days after angioplasty. nitroglycerin was tapered off and thepatient was discharged on 9 of january of note , the 4+ proteinuriawas unresolved at the time of discharge , because of his unstablecourse and transfers between the intensive care unit and the floor ,we were unable to complete a 24-hour urine collection. this issuewill be addressed further.disposition: the patient will be discharged to home. medicationson discharge were aspirin 325 milligrams by moutheach day , lopressor 100 milligrams by mouth twice a day. conditionon discharge was stable. the patient will follow-up with dr. jewel fennel in the tor'ssum healthcareestimated disability is none.dictated by: oscar d. dume , m.d. pollri dr

the patient is a 65 year old womanwith a history of coronary arterydisease , presenting with progressive symptoms for cardiaccatheterization. her cardiac history began in 20 of april , when shepresented with new substernal chest pain. she ruled in for anon-q-wave myocardial infarction , was treated with medical therapyand did well , until 5 of october , when she had progressive exertional chestheaviness and shortness of breath. an exercise tolerance test waspositive at that time , and echocardiogram showed good leftventricular function. she had a cardiac catheterization whichshowed a 90% left anterior descending , 75% first diagonal , 75%second diagonal. the cardiac catheterization was complicated byfoot cellulitis , sepsis and deep vein thrombosis and she was in andout of the hospital for several months recovering. given this , shewas hesitant to undergo further procedures and was treated withmedical therapy. the patient did fairly well with stable anginaand shortness of breath , until 1 year prior to admission when shehad slowly progressive increase in her chest heaviness andshortness of breath , limiting her activities. her anginal patternhas not changed recently in a significant manner , but over the lastseveral months her pain has been extremely limiting to heractivities , and thus she presented for cardiac catheterization anda question of revascularization. the patient has stable 2-pilloworthopnea , she has claudication with a 10-minute walk relieved withrest. the patient denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. her chestpain is not

dilated cardiomyopathy.problem list: 1 ) cardiomyopathy.2 ) status post multiple injuries.3 ) history of hepatitis b.history of present illness: the patient is a 42 year-old gentlemanwith dilated cardiomyopathy withworsening functional status. he was admitted for transplantwork-up , right heart catheterization and optimization of hismedical treatment. he initially developed symptoms approximatelysix years prior to admission with complaints of dyspnea andorthopnea. his chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegalyand ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilatedcardiomyopathy. in 1992 , a catheterization was performed withclean coronary arteries by report. in february of 1994 , he had a""cerebrovascular accident"". he was on coumadin at that time. hissymptoms included right hand and face anesthesia and hemiplegiawhich lasted only a few seconds and were self resolved. a ct wasnegative by report. he was started on coumadin subsequently. infebruary of 1994 , he had an echocardiogram which demonstrated aleft ventricular end diastolic diameter of 6.2 cm and ejectionfraction of 20%. there was no thrombus seen. there was 2+ mitralregurgitation. there were no regional wall motion abnormalities.he was doing fairly well at home with medical management withoutany admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier thisyear. he began to have worsening symptoms following a viralillness in october of 1997. at that time an echocardiogram inoctober of 1997 demonstrated a probably left ventricular thrombusand ejection fraction of 12%. his lasix dose was increased and hisatenolol dose was decreased. he improved and in october of 1997 , hewas able to participate in activities such as sledding and skatingwith only occasional chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion. inoctober of 1997 , an exercise tolerance test was performed which hewent 11 minutes. maximum heart rate was 148. his rate pressureproduct was 18 , 000 and the peak oxygen consumption was 20.4. atthe time nitrates were added to his regimen. his atenolol wasincreased. however , nitrates were discontinued because of headacheand insomnia. now , over the prior one to two months , proceedingadmission , he has had worsening symptoms with orthopnea , dyspnea onminimal exertion with less than one flight of stairs , decreasedappetite. his weight is stable , but it is felt to be a decrease inthe body amount with an increase in fluid weight. he has nocturnalshortness of breath and dyspnea. there is no syncope. he was seenby dr. parker willy and was felt to be at that time a class fouron the thyna 1 , cuse , nebraska 41604 . his lasix was increased and hewas referred for admission.review of systems: positive for orthopnea as well as paroxysmalnocturnal dyspnea four out of seven nights.there is no nocturia. his exercise tolerance is approximately oneflight of stairs with moderate shortness of breath. he complainsof nausea and anorexia without vomiting. he also has insomnia anderectile difficulties. he has a 6 lb. weight loss over the weekprior to admission following an increase in outpatient diureticuse. his baseline weight was 175 lbs. one month ago , it was 165lbs. and the day of admission , it is 155 lbs.past medical history: notable for cardiomyopathy as above , gunshotwound to his chest and head at the age of 14and motor vehicle accident , hepatitis b. he has had fourcolonoscopies in the past and has had no polyps.past surgical history: notable for appendectomy and a ganglioncyst in his right wrist.medications on admission: 1 ) enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5 )digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) kay ciel

daughters iny he was a former smoker who quit in 1984. previously , hehad smoked one to two packs per day for twelve years. he continuesto use alcohol and drinks approximately six beers per week.family history: his father is 70 years old. his mother is 68. hehas a sister with colon polyps and a brother whois healthy. his family history is otherwise notable for familialcolon cancer and polyposis.physical examination: vital signs: weight 72 kg , afebrile , heartrate 78 , blood pressure 95/71 , respiratoryrate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. heent isnormocephalic , atraumatic. oropharynx revealed multiple fillings ,but there is no abnormality. his neck is supple with nothyromegaly , carotid bruits or jugular venous distension. hisjugular venous pressure is 6 cm. his chest is clear. his cardiacexamination is regular rate and rhythm with an s3 as well as rightventricular impulse palpable and audible. his abdomen was soft ,non-tender with normal active bowel sounds. he had no bruits. hisliver is 12-14 cm and 1 cm below the right costal margin. thereare no masses. his extremities were warm and well perfused.neurological examination revealed a mild right facial asymmetry ,but otherwise , his neurological examination is non-focal.laboratory: laboratory evaluation on admission was notable for asodium of 133 , creatinine 1.2. liver function testsare notable for a bilirubin of 1.7 and 0.7. his complete bloodcount is unremarkable. his inr was 1.4. his urinalysis wasunremarkable. pulmonary function tests on admission included anfvc of 81% of predicted and fev1 of 78% of predicted and anfev1/fvc ratio of 97% of predicted. his dlco is 90% of predicted.ekg demonstrated sinus rhythm at 80 with first degreeatrioventricular block. his pr interval is 0.226. his qrsinterval is 0.10 and his qtc is 0.401. there was a left anteriorhemi-block. his axis is -49 degrees. there was left atrialenlargement. there was poor r-wave progression. there wereflipped t-waves across the precordium. there was an increase inleft atrial size since october of 1997 , otherwise no acute changes.hospital course: this is a 42 year-old gentleman with idiopathicdilated cardiomyopathy now presented withworsening functional status over the past few months as well asrecent fluid overload necessitating increase in lasix. there was aquestion of patient non-compliance especially given his currentalcohol use which raises the question of psychologic readiness forcardiac transplant at this time. following admission , the patientunderwent a right heart catheterization which demonstrated rightatrial pressure of 7 , right ventricular pressure of 55/12 , papressures of 58/32 , mean wedge pressure of 30 , arterial pressure atthe time was 113/74 with a mean of 90. additionally , by fick , hiscardiac output was 2.85 with a cardiac index of 1.49 , pulmonaryvenous resistance of 280 and a systemic venous resistance of 2 , 330.because of this markedly high svr and a borderline pvr , he wasstarted on intravenous nitrates with intravenous nitroprusside witha significant decrease in his svr as well as his pa pressures.this was felt to be a significant enough reduction in his pressuresto suggest that he would be a successful transplant candidate.therefore , he was transitioned to oral nitrates and started onisordil by mouth. however , he developed intolerance to nitrateswith severe headaches and ultimately all nitrates werediscontinued. he was subsequently managed only on afterloadreduction. his analopril was held and he was started on captoprilwhich was titrated up with good maintenance of his decrease inpressure. additionally , he was started on losartan for furtherafterload reduction which he tolerated well without orthostaticsymptoms. his lasix was gradually increased and he continued tohave quite a significant improvement symptomatically with nofurther orthopnea in the hospital. further parts of the cardiactransplant work-up were undertaken including ppd and controls whichwere placed. there was no reaction to either ppds or controls at72 hours. he had a b12 and folate level drawn which were withinnormal limits. his thyroid function test demonstrated a tsh of 1.9and all other parameters were within normal limits. digoxin levelon discharge was maintained in a therapeutic range. hepatitispanel was sent and he was negative for hepatitis b antigen orantibody as well as hepatitis c antibodies. 24 hour urinecollection was obtained for creatinine and his creatinine clearancewas at 88 at 24 hours. pulmonary function tests were as notedabove. he was seen by dental consult and was felt to have a fewminor restorative needs which could be taken care of by hisoutpatient dentist , but he was dentally cleared otherwise for atransplant. subsequent to his medical changes and his transplantwork-up , he was restarted on his coumadin and was discharged whenhis inr had become greater than 2 with a target range of 2 to 2.5planned. echocardiogram was performed on october , 1997 whichdemonstrated 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+ mitral regurgitation ,severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 20%.there was diffuse severe hypokinesis and apical akinesis. therewas evidence of echo contrast within the left ventricle suggestinga clot. there was moderate left atrial enlargement.condition on discharge: the patient was discharged in stablecondition. he was markedly improved froma symptomatic point of view on discharge.follow-up: the patient is to follow-up with dr.

monforeadmission diagnosis:congestive heart failure.principal discharge diagnoses:1. congestive heart failure.2. diastolic dysfunction.3. hypertension.4. diabetes mellitus.5. serratia uti.6. chronic renal dysfunction.7. dyslipidemia.8. coronary artery disease.9. mild pulmonary hypertension.10. mitral regurgitation.allergies:penicillins.brief history of present illness:the patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents withshortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea forapproximately three weeks. he has a history of coronary arterydisease with an mi in 1994 and four-vessel cabg with subsequentlyplaced five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis ,hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baselinecreatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) ,hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. heis presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea ,and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightnesswithout radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent.he presents after coming to an outside hospital with three tofour days of these worsening symptoms. he was transferred tobaspit hospital where he received most of hiscardiac care. the patient had these worsening heart failuresymptoms after a trip to i hwy , ny vale , michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion anda five-pound weight gain. he has had no syncope , palpitations ,but has had some mild nausea without emesis. at the outsidehospital when he presented , his ekg showed a baseline leftbundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. he was givensome lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed anejection fraction of 35%. he was transferred to me ale firstray hospital , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as aheparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeatechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior walldistal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction andmoderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. this is consistent withan echocardiogram that he received in 1/8 . uponpresentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 ,blood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasalcanula. his jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. his lungs hadrales bilaterally , approximately half way up. he had nodullness. his heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the leftaxilla. he had no s3 , and no s4. his abdomen was mildlydistended. he had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. hisextremities were warm. he had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalispedis pulses bilaterally. ekg at baneers hospitalrevealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch patternand no significant st wave changes and an occasional pvc.admission laboratories:significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a bun of 76 , potassium of5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and pt-t was 56 on heparin drip.brief resume of hospital course:1. ischemia. the patient has an extensive history of coronaryartery disease. he is maintained on aspirin , plavix , low dosebeta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ace inhibitor and statin.he initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt asdemand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonaryhypertension. his enzymes trended down and were negative afterthe initial check. eventually , the patient received 48 hours ofintravenous heparin as well as iv nitroglycerin and was chestpain free. at this point , he received an adenosine mibi nuclearstudy , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with avery small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that wasfelt to be nonrevascularizable. he was maintained on optimummedical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterizationin this gentleman who had already had previous history of renaldysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye loadwas not warranted nor indicated at this time. by discharge , hewas ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. coronaryartery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his chfexacerbation.2. pump. the patient had an ejection fraction of 45% uponadmission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. he wasinitially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination oflasix and natrecor. at this point , his pulmonary edema hadresolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. given thefact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid furtherdiuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what hisright and left heart filling pressures were. the patient wastaken to the cardiovascular diagnostic laboratory and received aright heart catheterization. his pulmonary capillary wedgepressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary arterypressure 56/18. his ra pressure was 8. there was some initialfalse elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cathlab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailoredtherapy to the cardiac care unit where he had a pulmonary arterycatheter in place. at this point , his after-load reduction wasmaximized with combination of hydralazine and isordil with goodeffect. his creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to2.7. his symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2liters of the patient. by discharge , the patient was actuallybecoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , acalcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. ofnote , the patient has been exposed to ace inhibition in the pastand is currently not on an ace inhibitor. in the past , he hadhad a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ace inhibition. on anoutpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient havea trial of ace or arb to optimize his after-load reduction andneurohormonal activation with his heart failure. the patient'sheart failure regimen includes standing lasix , carvedilol ,isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomaticimprovement.3. rhythm. the patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. he wasmaintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. hiselectrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker.he had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia lessthan 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. the patient isnot at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricularpacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if hisqrs interval is greater than 150 ms.4. pulmonary. given the fact that the patient had a normalpulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary arterypressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal diseasewas undertaken. he had a high resolution chest ct , which showedmild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent withpulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. he alsohad pulmonary function tests. pulmonary function tests revealedan fvc of 1.88 liters and an fev1 of 1.33 liters. this gives anfev1 to fvc percent of 71%. he has both decreased fvc and fev1 ,but an fev1 and fvc percent that is most consistent with a mildrestriction. his lung volumes are approximately 50% predictedsuggestive of a restrictive process and his dlco both correctedand uncorrected are 50% predicted. his corrected dlco is 13.5.it is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lungdisease given the absence of definitive interstitial process onhigh resolution chest ct. a more likely explanation for thesefindings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequatediuresis with his congestive heart failure. the patient wassating 98% on room air at the time of discharge.5. endocrine. the patient has very difficult to controldiabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both nph and lisprosliding scale while in house. he was briefly hypoglycemic duringhis initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection.this resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding hislong-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy.he was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of nph in the a.m. and p.m.respectively as well as a lispro scale at the time of discharge.furthermore , the patient was found to have a tsh of 0.219 as wellas a normal t4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism ,which is consistent with over replacement with synthroid such asmaintenance synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcgand we recommend a tsh to be checked in late february 2004.6. renal. the patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiencypresumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. hehas had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with acreatinine bump to nearly 7. we wanted to avoid as much contrastdye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renalinsufficiency. we ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three timesweekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19.his creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge andhis bun was 67. he was making good urine and had no evidence ofresidual urinary tract infection.7. infectious disease. upon presentation , the patient after afoley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic.urine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of serratiamarcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosedlevofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms.8. neuropsych. the patient has a history of depression and hadsome mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection ,which resolved with p.r.n. zyprexa as well as treating of theunderlying condition. psychiatric service was consulted and feltlike he had a resolving medical delirium and there is noindication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at thistime. ( his mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributedto his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman ofthis age is not uncommon. )9. prophylaxis. the patient was maintained on nexium for giprophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for dvt prophylaxis.code status:the patient is full code.the patient was consulted by both physical therapy andoccupational therapy who felt that acute rehabilitation would bewarranted at this time.disposition:the patient was discharged in stable condition on room air andwas chest pain free to the irbar medical center the patient's health care proxy is his wife , mrs.blake maker , whose phone number is ( 158 ) 000-3426. he willbe followed by dr. valentine cloer at as medical centerschedule appointments with dr. jo ( 703 ) 219-1739. the patient's primary care physician is dr. arthur widener at ( 865 ) 227-2987. the patient should be maintained on afluid-restricted diet of less than 2 liters of fluid total. heshould have low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat as well as adiabetic diet with ada 2100 calories per day. he should also besodium restricted to less than 2 g daily. activity to be guidedby physical therapy at noneto do:1. titrate amlodipine p.r.n. the patient has tolerated up to 10mg amlodipine in the past.2. consider outpatient trial of ace inhibitor or arb in thefuture with close monitoring of potassium.3. recheck tsh late february 2004.4. complete former days of antibiotics for serratia urinarytract infection.discharge condition:stable.discharge medications:1. tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache.2. vitamin c 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.

the procedurewas complicated by a left ureteral injury for which urology wasconsulted intraoperatively. urology placed a left ureteral stentintraoperatively and made recommendations to maintain stent for atotal of six weeks after which time it would be removed on anoutpatient basis ( dr. mahaffy will be following this case ). inaddition , they recommended maintaining foley for five days. theebl during the case was 2500 cc necessitating transfusion of 4units of packed red blood cells. she was extubated and taken tothe pacu in stable condition with an epidural in place onperioperative antibiotics of clindamycin and with ng tube inplace. onpostoperative day #1 , it was noted that the patient wasincreasingly becoming confused and anxious as well as remainedtachycardic despite what was thought to be adequate volumeresuscitation and she was transferred to the unit at this point.more specifically , in addition to being tachycardic later thatday on postoperative day #1 , she became tachypneic with notedhypoxemia and mental status changes in need of intubation. ofnote , the patient was saturating at 96% on 100% oxygen viafacemask. it is also notable that the patient in the 24-hourperioperative window received 14-liter of fluid resuscitation.the night of postoperative day #1 , as mentioned earlier , thepatient was increasingly agitated before she was transferred tothe unit and although discontinued her ng tube it was thought atthis time that she may have aspirated. she also removed hersupplemental oxygen and was noted to have saturations in the 85%range with tachycardia in the 140 range. a pe protocol ct wasobtained that was negative for emboli or dvt but was positive forright upper lobe posterior segment consolidation that wasconsistent with an aspiration event. she was subsequentlytransferred on the night of postoperative day #1 to the icu ,intubated , and had a right ij central line placed. overnight ,between postoperative day #1 and postoperative day #2 , her bloodpressure would drop requiring multiple fluid boluses in additionto the administration of an additional unit of packed red bloodcells for a hematocrit of 23. she also received albumin. ofnote , the ct also did not reveal any evidence of acute bleed;however , this was a noncontrast study. she was placed on versedand propofol , intubated in the unit with a fentanyl patch ,remained tachycardic , the origin of which was unclear. it wasthought initially that there was some type of narcotic controlthat may be responsible for this tachycardia. however , it wasalso speculated that she may be bleeding from an unknown source.she was intubated , npo , ng tube in place with iv fluidresuscitation , foley in place per urology as noted above , on subqheparin with close monitoring of the hematocrit with transfusionsto be given as necessary placed on a triple regimen ofclindamycin , levo , and flagyl. on postoperative day #3 , thepatient in the unit with hypertension , anemia , tachycardia , thepatient's hematocrit was still 23 and she received 2 additionalunits of red blood cells and hematocrit rose to 30 at this time.she was poorly responsive on postoperative day #3 and it wasthought that she had better be weaned off of versed whichhappened to be replaced with haloperidol. in addition , clonidinewas added to her regimen as well as lopressor secondary to hertachycardia. there was close examination of her mental statusduring this time. on postoperative day #4 , the patient was stillpersistently tachycardic and hypertensive. jp was discontinuedon the day and , in addition , as noted above , haldol and clonidinewere added to her regimen. she continued to be agitated andthere was a question raised then that there was an unclearhistory that was not previously diagnosed of alcoholism and thismay have been an alcohol withdrawal phenomenon. so , her versedactually was increased then for a questionable alcohol withdrawaland she was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate and inaddition for her hypertension lopressor 5 q.4 was continued. shewas still intubated with goals of weaning off ventilation , npo ,ng tube to low suction , the question of tpn was raised , levo andflagyl for aspiration pneumonia which would be continued for10-14 days. by postoperative day #5 , it was clear that this wasa problem of drug or alcohol withdrawal at least that was whatwas thought. her neuro regimen was changing at this time withvarious measures using versed , then using ativan , and apresodexto changing her fentanyl regimen as well as adding morphine toher regimen p.r.n. all with goals of increasing the generalrelaxation. psych was consulted on postoperative day #5 andconcluded that this woman had a history of polysubstance abuse ,alcohol and likely opiates , and chronic abdominal pain due tostricture which probably was related to her opioid abuse; ibelieve the delirium was likely multifactorial in etiology ,postoperative delirium that was notable for significant fluidshifts , there was the question of aspiration pneumonia inaddition to possible opiate and alcohol withdrawal. theyrecommended starting with zyprexa if the patient was sedated inthe a.m. with a dc a.m. dose of zyprexa and just use it in theevening and agreed to taper off the versed minimizing the use ofopiates as tolerated by the patient and encouraged the family toreorient the patient to keep her awake during the day. onpostoperative day #6 , her mental status was gradually clearing.patient goal was to wean off sedation for a possible extubation.her blood pressure as well as heart rate were stabilizing andtube feeds were also started at this point with multivitamins andmineral replacement. in addition , urine output continued to begood. her hematocrit was stable. her cultures were at thispoint negative , but the antibiotic flagyl-levo regimen wascontinued. of note , her stoma would gradually start to producefluid and her incision during this leg of her course remainedclean , dry , and intact. on postoperative day #6 , she was alsoconsulted by addiction psychiatry who concluded similar resultsto recommendations concluded earlier. they would agree with thezyprexa and also recommended restarting ativan , as i said ,additionally agreeing with the taper off of the versed with theuse of ativan only for cases of agitation and additionallyrecommended to the discontinue the celexa and buspar the patientwas on until the delirium cleared to avoid a polypharmacy. ofnote , psyche was able to speak with the husband who confirmed thepatient's longstanding history of alcohol dependence that likelypredated the 10 years that he had known her. it is important tonote that the patient was consuming approximately a quart ofvodka a day as well as peppermint schnapps daily up until hersurgery last april . after that procedure , she continued todrink presumably about 3 beers a day. however , the husband sincehe was working so much was unable to really adequately guage justhow much alcohol she was drinking. in addition , she was noted tohave , this is per the husband , undergone multiple detoxes attreatment facilities for alcohol dependence and believed that shehad experience withdrawal seizures in the past. on postoperativeday #7 , the patient's mental status was gradually improving withweaning off of her versed with iv ativan and low doses astolerated and p.r.n. she , in addition , this day was toleratingher tube feeds; however , she did pull her ng tube again. her foleywas taken out at this time. the ureteral injury believed to beresolved at this point , continued on her levo and flagyl withquestion of whether or not to stop her antibiotic regimen. onpostoperative day #8 , mental status continued to improve and shewas started on sips which she tolerated well. her iv was heplocked and she was seen fit to be transferred to the floor. ofnote , also on postoperative day #8 , the patient had some lowblood pressure which was treated with volume resuscitation in theform of normal saline boluses that stabilized right after hertransfer to the floor. on postoperative day #9 , it was notedthat the patient had some red stool in the ostomy bag. thepatient was hemodynamically stable this was afternoon ofpostoperative day #9. her labs were checked , cbc , and found tobe within normal limits and her ibuprofen which she was takingwas discontinued. on postoperative day #10 , with mental statusimproving greatly , the patient had her central line discontinued.over the last couple of days , she had made attempts to walk andwas walking with pt. her diet over the last couple of days hadbeen advanced without any problems and she was converted to ahouse diet on postoperative day #10. on postoperative day #11 ,her mental status seemingly completely resolved on regular diet ,out of bed. it was noted though that she had some erythema ofthe mid portion of her wound , three staples were removed fromthis portion of the wound and serosanguinous exudate wasexpressed , minimal amount of fluid. the wound was explored andthere was found to be no fascial defect. cultures were taken atthis time and the wound was packed with wet-to-dry dressing withinstructions given to the patient and nursing for wet-to-drydressing changes t.i.d. on postoperative day #11 , the patientwas seen fit to be discharged home. her mental status hadcompletely resolved. she was afebrile and hemodynamicallystable , tolerating a regular diet , and fully ambulatory. she wasto be discharged home with vna services. medicine team that hadbeen seeing her did agree that she needed to contact herpsychiatrist to provide an update of the current admission toupdate her on her medical regimen inhouse and she is to schedulean appointment to follow up with her psychiatrist. the medicineteam also recommended continuing her psyche medications she wastaking prior to admission that includes celexa 4 mg q.d. , buspar10 mg t.i.d. , nortriptyline will be started by her psychiatrist.also recommended to continue ativan taper as followed with 1 mgt.i.d. today , 1 mg b.i.d. the next day which would have been5/29 , and then 1 mg q.a.m. on wednesday 6/26, and then stoptaking the ativan with instructions of no refills on the ativan.the medicine team also strongly enforced , reminded her not todrink while taking the ativan.allergies and medicine reactions:iv keflex gives her a rash.operations and procedures:on 7/20/04 , the patient received a sigmoid colectomy , adiverting ostomy.hospital course by problem:see hpi.complications:1. intraoperative complication of left ureteral injury.2. alcohol opiate withdrawal.discharge medications:buspar 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , fentanyl patch 100 mcg/h. and topicalq.72h. , folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.d. , dilaudid 2-4 mg p.o. q.4h.p.r.n. pain , thiamine , hcl 100 mg p.o. q.d. , celexa 40 mg p.o.q.d. , ativan with a tapered dose of 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. to betapered on the following day to 1 mg p.o. q.d. and then on day #3to just 1 mg in the a.m. , protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , neurontin 600mg p.o. t.i.d. , and clonodine 0.2 mg p.o. q. weekly.disposition:home with vna services.escription document: 1-9452678 emssten teldictated by: janczak , joeyattending: macomber , geraldodictation id 6134283d: 3/18/04t: 2/5/04",0

pressure had dropped to 95/60 and he wassymptomatically orthostatic. esophagogastroduodenoscopy wasperformed in the emergency ward , which showed an actively bleeding1 cm antral lesion in the greater

vital signs: temperature was 96.8 ,heart rate was 76 , respiratory rate was 18 , blood pressure152/79 , o2 saturation was 94% on two liters. in general , she wasin no acute distress and pleasant. cardiovascular exam: she hadan irregular rhythm with audible s1 and s2. no s3 was heard. nomurmurs. no jugular venous distension. chest was clear toauscultation bilaterally. her abdomen had increased bowelsounds , was tympanitic , was diffusely tender. her extremitieshad no edema.labs: she had a white blood cell count of 14 , hematocrit of 42 ,platelets of 221 , 000 , sodium of 144 , potassium of 4 , chloride of109 , bicarb of 28 , bun of 20 , creatinine of 1.6 , blood glucose of200 , troponin i was less than assay , ck was 118 , inr of 2.6. kubx-ray showed dilated loops of small bowel consistent with smallbowel obstruction. ekg showed atrial fibrillation at 78 beatsper minute with an incomplete right bundle branch block , an oldinferior mi with loss of anterior fossa.hospital course: the patient's abdominal pain was most likelydue to small bowel obstruction secondary to a ventral hernia. itwas decided by the surgical service that the ventral herniashould be fixed operatively. the medical service evaluated thepatient , decided that her chest pain was her normal baselineangina and she had no acute coronary syndrome at the time ofadmission. recommendations were made to discontinue hercoumadin , allow her inr to fall to 1.8 before operating. thepatient was also to be given generous boluses of normal salinepreoperatively to avoid hypotension and tight blood sugar controlduring her hospital course. the patient was admitted to themedical floor before her operation and was scheduled for ventralhernia repair several days later. during her stay on thesurgical ward , the patient had developed complaints of new visualchanges described as objects of floating in her visual field. atthis point , a ct scan of the head was done to rule out an acutecerebral avascular accident. head ct was initially read asnormal. no acute bleed. however re-read as showing a left-sidedsub acute thalamic infarct of 10 days to 2 weeks age. at thispoint , a neurological consultation was obtained. the neurologyconsultant recommended an mri/mra of the head and neck toevaluate for possible hidden acute stroke and a carotidultrasound to assess her carotid artery patency. the mri/mra ofher head was negative , a carotid ultrasound was done which wasalso negative with no lesions similar to her previous carotidartery ultrasound of 10/1 a transthoracic echocardiogram wasalso done to evaluate for atrial clots. her echocardiogram waslargely unchanged from her previous echocardiogram of 2002. shehad normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of55% and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. given this negativeworkup for any acute stroke , it was decided to obtain anophthalmology consult to evaluate the patient's visual changes.the ophthalmology consultant attributed her visual changes tovitreous humor particulate matter , which is very common in olderpeople. it was most likely the cause of her visual changes. theophthalmology consultant recommended q.d. pred forte drops ineach eye for her status post corneal transplant.the patient was finally taken to the operating room on hospitalday 7 for ventral hernia repair. the operation was uncomplicatedwith minimal blood loss. postoperatively , the patient's courseprogressed well with good pain control , good progression of dietand good ambulation. postoperatively , the patient was restartedon coumadin and placed on iv heparin for prophylaxis secondary toher mitral valve prosthetic. the patient remained in thehospital for seven days after her operation for adequateanticoagulation with coumadin. on postop day 3 , the patient wasnoticed to have bright red blood in her urine. a urologicalconsult was obtained for evaluation of gross hematuria. cat scanshowed several centimeters of calcified bladder wall , which isindicative of infection versus tumor. however no gross tumormass was observed and the remainder of her collecting system wasnormal. the urological consult recommended follow up in urologyclinic in two to four weeks. the patient was then discharged onpostop day 7 to the awind pitwell medical center for continued physical

diabetes mellitus. the patient had reported poor diabeticcontrol as an outpatient. therefore , her regimen was continued ,with the addition of a sliding scale , in order to determine theadditional insulin needs as an outpatient. over the course ofthe admission , the patient's lantus was increased to 20 units atnighttime , and she was using 8 units three times a day of insulinlispro , in addition to a lispro sliding scale. with thisregimen , the fingerstick glucose control improved , and thefasting blood sugar on the day of discharge was 90. on the dayprior to discharge , the patient had blood sugars in the rangefrom 93 to 139. an hba1c was sent , which was 6.7 , during thisadmission , the patient also had a nutrition consult. she will befollowed in the high-risk obstetric and

day afteradmission. this revealed an ejection fraction of 50% as well asa large left ventricular thrombosis , which was presumed to be alongstanding. cardiology was consulted and the impression wasthat the thrombosis was likely a combination of her leftventricular hypokinesia related to the previous infarct , as wellas her hypercoagulable state. therefore , their recommendationwas to start the patient on lovenox for the duration of thispregnancy , which adjusted for her weight was a dose of 90 mgdaily , followed by a transition to coumadin postpartum , to becontinued for likely long-term , possibly lifelong duration. thecardiology consult team noted that the mthfr mutation had notresulted in elevated homocysteine levels in the past. however ,they did agree that folate supplementation at high doses wasindicated. the patient will be continued on lovenox 90 mg dailysubcutaneously , and aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily as an outpatient.she will have cardiology followup with

patient had liver function tests and ahepatitis panel on this admission , given her history of activedisease diagnosed in 2005 , with a positive hepatitis e antigen.on admission , the patient had not been on epivir , which had beenstopped prior to this current pregnancy. liver function testswere checked on this admission and were within normal limits. inaddition , serologies were checked and the hepatitis e antigen andthe e antibody was negative. hepatitis b surface antigen and hepatitis bcore antigen were reactive. at the time of this dictation , ahepatitis b viral load was pending. given the patient's historyof hepatitis b , an outpatient appointment was being arranged atthe time of discharge , with dr. lavy , from the division ofgastroenterology at the sasspan hospital . it wasdecided that the patient should not take any lamivudine untilgastroenterology followup. during the entire hospital stay , thepatient did not have any gi complaints , was tolerating a regulardiet , and having normal regular bowel movements.4. history of fibroids , the patient was noted again to have an 8-cm fibroidon her ultrasound scan. she required rare intermittent doses ofoxycodone as required for pain , which was presumed to be relatedto her fibroid uterus.5. prenatal care. the patient had her first trimester labs senton this admission. gc and chlamydia testing were negative.urine culture was negative. the patient was o +ve. given thepatient's history of mthfr mutation and the recurrent sabs , thepatient was started on prenatal vitamins , as well as high-dosefolic acid , b12 and b6. in view of the patient's diabetichistory , and a transiently elevated creatinine to 1.2 on hospitalday 2 , which went back to 0.7 on the day of discharge , thepatient had a 24-hour urine collection sent , this returnednegative at 92 mg per 24 hours. it was noted that the patienthad an ophthalmology retinal exam at an outside hospital healthcenter this year. for the remainder of this

contrast showed an old left centrum semiovale lesion ,consistent with with a watershed infarct. there was no evidence ofacute bleed.hospital course: the patient is a 63 year-old hispanic male withthe following important medical issues to bemanaged:( 1 ) cardiovascular. the patient presented without chest pain , butekg changes , including .5 mm of st segment depression in lead i ,and 1 mm of st segment depression in leads ii , and v4 through v6.there was no prior ekg for comparison. given his multiple cardiacrisk factors , a decision was made to rule the patient out formyocardial infarction. his serial creatinine kinase levels were67/74/115. given the low levels , there was no mb fractionationdone. the patient also was placed on holter monitor to attempt torule out a dysrhythmic etiology of his deficit. holter showedpredominantly a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 442 to 98. therewere 7 atrial premature beats , and 5 ventricular premature beats ,as well as a 12-beat run of supraventricular tachycardia at a rateof 125 , and a 6-beat run of ventricular tachycardia at 144. all ofthese were asymptomatic. the patient underwent transthoracicechocardiography while an inpatient , to rule out a vegetativesource of emboli , which may have resulted in his change insensation. echocardiogram demonstrated concentric left ventricularhypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 65%. there was athickened aortic leaflet with calcification of the right and leftcoronary cusps of the aortic valve. no shunt was visualized. thepatient had no occurrence of chest pain or shortness of breathwhile admitted to the louili mi hospital . these eventswere thought to be entirely non-cardiac in nature , and he wasremoved from telemetry. the patient's hypertension was managedwith nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. during this admission , andswitched to 30 mg of nifedipine xl p.o. q.d. as an outpatient. hisblood pressure should be followed as an outpatient , and additionsand adjustments made accordingly.( 2 ) neurologic. the patient was admitted with what appeared to bea purse sensory defect of the right hemisphere , resulting in leftfacial and upper extremity numbness. he was seen in consultationby the neurology service. ct scan of the head without contrast inthe emergency room was negative for acute bleed. in the emergencyroom , the patient received one enteric coated aspirin , and he wasnot started on intravenous heparinization. it was unclear ,initially , whether the etiology of this patient's change inneurological status was secondary to embolic phenomena or possiblya second watershed infarct. given his negative echocardiogram ofthe heart , as well as a negative holter monitor , it was thoughtthat the etiology of this patient's left-sided facial numbness wasnot cardiac in nature. it was the feeling of the neurology servicethat the patient had experienced a right-sided subcortical infarct ,probably in the right thalamus region. he was also noted to haverisk factors for small vessel disease , including hypertension anddiabetes. his numbness appeared to be resolving on aspirin alone;however , on the second day of admission , the patient began todevelop dysarthria. there was concern that the patient was havingan evolving cerebrovascular accident that was involving thebrainstem , given tongue involvement. he was thus started onintravenous heparinization. his dysarthria promptly resolved. heunderwent mri with and without contrast of the head , three daysafter the initial event , which demonstrated only right-sided smallvessel disease. there was no evidence of acute bleed or underlyingvascular abnormality. given the small vessel disease in thispatient , he was taken off intravenous heparin and continued on oneaspirin a day. he did well during the remainder of his stay. hewas seen in consultation by physical therapy and occupationaltherapy , who , in conjunction with the patient's family , believedthat he was at a somewhat decreased level of functioning from hisbaseline , given his sensory changes. he is thus to be sent forinpatient rehabilitation for his new cerebrovascular accident , andthen to be followed as an outpatient in dr. lacrosse 's clinic. hewill continue on one aspirin a day for life. his right-sidedscapular and shoulder pain is chronic , after sustaining his initialleft-sided cerebrovascular accident. it should be treated withphysical therapy , including ultrasound and stretching maneuvers.the patient was also placed on naproxen for pain relief.muscle relaxants may be tried as an outpatient if the above statedefforts do not help reduce this patient's pain.( 3 ) infectious disease. this patient had no infectiouscomplications while hospitalized. he was , however , found to have aslight peripheral eosinophilia during this admission , and wasevaluated by o&p of the stool. stool evaluation showed moderatehook worm eggs , as well as rare trichuris trichiura eggs. he wastreated with three days of mebendazole.( 4 ) endocrine. the patient has a history of type ii diabetes , ondiabeta. the patient's blood glucose levels were checked by fingerstick four times daily , and were in the 190's to 240's range duringthis admission. he was covered with a czi sliding scale of regularinsulin. the patient was advised by dietary on the americandiabetic association diet. he is to continue

patient is a 68 year old gentlemanwho has a past medical history ofnon-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease ,and peripheral vascular disease who had a revascularizationprocedure with a left femoral popliteal bypass graft in august of1998. since that time his foot has become cool and the graft hasbeen noted to be occluded. he presents for a re-operation forrevascularization.past medical history: non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.coronary artery disease status post coronaryartery bypass graft in 1991 and series of angioplasties prior tothe coronary artery bypass graft. gastroesophageal reflux disease.non-healing left foot ulcer with no osteomyelitis. hypertension.peripheral vascular disease.medications: glyburide 5 mg p.o.

surgical history: in 1991 he had a coronary artery bypassgraft. his postoperative course wascomplicated only by atrial fibrillation which was medically managedand he has been without recurrence since that time. in august of1998 he had a left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibialartery bypass graft with non-reversed greater saphenous vein andleft common femoral endarterectomy with dacron patch angioplasty ,as well as debridement of the left lateral foot wound. after thissurgery , he had an uncomplicated postoperative course.social history: the patient quit smoking in the fall of 1998 anddoes not use alcohol.family history: noncontributory.review of systems: he has had no chest pain , shortness of breath ,or angina since the time of his bypass. justprior to his admission , he was seen by dr. frankie krampitz of harlsti conon memorial medical center cardiology and was cleared from a cardiacstandpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he hasdone well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms sincehis bypass surgery. additionally , his preoperative angiogramshowed his superficial femoral artery graft to be proximallyoccluded with mid to distal reconstitution. above the kneepopliteal artery , there was mild diffuse disease. below the kneepopliteal was patent. there was diffuse proximal disease in theperoneal and posterior tibial arteries. the posterior tibialoccludes above the knee and there is high grade focal stenosis atthe anterior tibial origin. the dorsalis pedis is patent.hospital course: on 2/10/99 the patient was brought to theoperating room where dr. moises performed a leftfemoral above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft. this went withoutcomplications. the type of graft used as a 6 mm dalcron graft.the immediate postoperative pulse examination was notable for apalpable femoral popliteal and graft pulse with a dopplerabledorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse on left side. thepatient had an ecg postoperatively that showed no significantchange to his preoperative ecg. he was started on heparin at 8p.m. the day of surgery.of note , on postoperative day #1 , the patient got very diaphoreticand nauseous. at that time an ecg was done that showed nosignificant change and , throughout that episode , he had nohemodynamic instability. this was likely secondary to havinggotten up rather quickly and likely a vasovagal event.throughout the rest of his hospitalization course the patient wasmobilized with physical therapy. he had a dopplerable dorsalispedis pulse , posterior tibial pulse , and peroneal pulse on leftside throughout his entire hospital course. however , the graft wasno longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was stronglydopplerable.the patient was continued on heparin until his coumadin reached thehigh 1 level which was achieved on 1/25/99 when his inr was 1.6. atthis time his heparin was discontinued. the anticoagulation is onfor keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or strokereasons. the goal on his inr will be approximately 2 to 2.5. on1/25/99 the patient was stable for discharge. his pulse examinationwas notable for dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posteriortibial pulse and peroneal pulse.the patient's record of coumadin in response with inr is asfollows: on 2/10/99 the patient was started on coumadin at whichpoint his inr was 1.0. on that day he got 5 mg of coumadin. thefollowing day , 5/27/99 , his inr was 1.1 and he got another 5 mg ofcoumadin. on 8/17/99 the patient's inr was 1.2 and he got another 5mg of coumadin. on 10/15/99 the patient got 7.5 mg of coumadin andhis inr was 1.2 at that time. on 6/8/99 the patient got 10 mg ofcoumadin and his inr was 1.6 the following day on the day ofdischarge , 1/3/99. on the day of

artery bypass graft in 1987with a lima to lad , svg to rca , svg to omb. over the past tenyears he has complained of increasing chf symptoms includingdyspnea on exertion , fatigue , chest tightness and has had multipleadmits for exacerbations , the most recent from november tomarch , 2001 for progressive fatigue. at that time a rightheart catheterization revealed high filling pressures and he wastreated with aggressive diuresis. angiography revealed occludedsvgs and a patent lima. dobutamine radionuclide study revealedinferior and inferolateral infarct. there was no evidence ofrevascularization. evaluation for heart transplant found cirrhosisby liver spleen scan which ruled out the possibility of transplant.he reported light-headedness and dizziness and was seen by theelectrophysiology service who performed an ep study which wasnegative for provokable vt and since he is not a transplantcandidate it was felt that empiric icd placement would not be inhis best interest. his light-headedness and presyncope worsened.his captopril dose was reduced from 37.5 mg to 25 mg t.i.d. withmarked improvement in his energy and less dizziness. over the pastweeks his dizziness and light-headedness recurred and worsened withepisodes of presyncope and frank syncope. on the day of admissionhe was scheduled for a clinic appointment. on arrival he feltdizzy and

years prior to admission. given hisorthostatic vital signs it was felt that his volume status andmedications were responsible for his symptoms. in addition hiselevated bun and creatinine were consistent with volume depletion.he improved off diuretics , nitrates and ace inhibitor as well asliberalization of his diet regarding salt and fluid intake. therewere no arrhythmias noted on his telemetry monitor. an endocrineconsult was called to evaluate for possible contribution ofautonomic insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. theyrecommended decreasing his synthroid dose due to a suppressed tshas well as more aggressive blood sugar control , however , they wereunable to document orthostatic hypotension and felt that hisepisodes of presyncope and syncope were related to

surgeryservice on 10/5/2004 for further evaluation and management. shewas empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime withwet-to-dry dressings applied to her right foot wound. thepatient was also continued on her prior dose of macrobid forpreviously-diagnosed uti with her antibiotic regimen to bediscontinued for this purpose on 9/8/2004 .  an angiogramperformed on hospital day #2 , revealed a right external iliacocclusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internaland external iliac vessels. a distal stenosis of the externaliliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. thepatient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the accesssite but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards.following her angiogram and percutaneous intervention , thepatient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremitydp and pt pulses which remained palpable through the duration ofher hospital course. on hospital day #3 , the patient was broughtto the operating room for debridement of her right foot. for adetailed description of the patient's operative procedure , pleasethe relevant operative note. patient tolerated the procedurewell and during the procedure , the patient's ulcer base was foundto be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum , andtherefore , a metatarsal head excision was performed. thepatient's great toe was left in place with moderate debridementof the deep tissues. the ulcers on the lateral right foot werenot debrided at this time. following her procedure , the patientwas empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. heroperative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staphwhich was sensitive to both keflex and vancomycin. at thispoint , the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only andwas continued on vac therapy through postoperative day #3. atthis point , the patient's vac dressing was changed to demonstratea well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulationtissue and no signs of wound necrosis. the patient remained instable condition through postoperative day #7 at which point , shewas returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation anddefinitive closure of her right foot wound. for a detaileddescription of this operative procedure , please see the relevantoperative note. the patient tolerated the procedure well and wassubsequently returned to the regular outpatient floor where sheremained for the duration of her stay. a general overview of thepatient's hospital course by system is as follows:1. neurological: the patient demonstrated significant issueswith pain control for the duration of her stay. a fair amount ofher pain was determined to be secondary to her right foot ulcer;however , the patient was also noted to have significant painassociated with her contracted right lower extremity. for atime , the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extensionbrace which provided some measure of relief; however , uponregular examination of her right lower extremity , it was notedthat she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary tothe extension brace. a neurology and pain service consultationwas obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended forzanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain controldramatically. the patient otherwise remained intact from aneurological perspective for the duration of her stay ,demonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with herbaseline examination.2. cardiovascular: the patient remained stable from acardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with noevidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise. at nopoint did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemiaor infarction.3. pulmonary: the patient remained stable from a pulmonaryperspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence ofacute respiratory decompensation.4. gi: the patient remained stable from a gastrointestinalstandpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to betolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake. upon discharge ,she was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid p.o. intakeand was noted to be independently productive of adequate amountsof stool and flatus.5. gu: as described previously , the patient was admitted with aknown diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. she was continuedon macrobid therapy through 9/8/2004 , at which point thistherapy was discontinued. subsequent follow-up urinalysesdemonstrated no further evidence of urinary tract infection.upon completion of her macrobid antibiotic course , the patient'sfoley catheter was removed and she was noted to be independentlyproductive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of herstay. she at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renalcompromise or electrolyte imbalance.6. heme: the patient remained stable with a stable hematocritfor the duration of her stay. she was started on plavix therapyfollowing her angiogram , on which she remains at the time of herdischarge. dvt prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparinfor the duration of her stay.7. id: as stated above , the patient's operative cultures werenoted to grow coag.-negative staph , sensitive to both vancomycinand keflex. for the majority of her stay , the patient remainedon vancomycin therapy but was transitioned to keflex on1/11/2004 , on which she remained for the duration of her stay.at the time of discharge , the patient has been instructed tocomplete an additional 10-day course of keflex therapy. of note ,the patient remained afebrile with a stable white count for theduration of her stay and her wound exam demonstrated no evidenceof further infection at the ulcer site.8. endocrine: the patient maintained adequately well-controlledblood sugars for the duration of her stay with no evidence ofacute endocrinological compromise. the patient was subsequentlycleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility onpostoperative days 10 and 3 , 7/11/2004 , with instructions forfollow up.condition on discharge: patient is to be discharged to arehabilitation facility with instructions for

wound. thepatient was also continued on her prior dose of macrobid forpreviously-diagnosed uti with her antibiotic regimen to bediscontinued for this purpose on 9/8/2004 .  an angiogramperformed on hospital day #2 , revealed a right external iliacocclusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internaland external iliac vessels. a distal stenosis of the externaliliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. thepatient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the accesssite but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards.following her angiogram and

the patient was broughtto the operating room for debridement of her right foot. for adetailed description of the patient's operative procedure , pleasethe relevant operative note. patient tolerated the procedurewell and during the procedure , the patient's ulcer base was foundto be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum , andtherefore , a metatarsal head excision was performed. thepatient's great toe was left in place with moderate debridementof the deep tissues. the ulcers on the lateral right foot werenot debrided at this time. following her procedure , the patientwas empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. heroperative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staphwhich was sensitive to both keflex and vancomycin. at thispoint , the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only andwas continued on vac therapy through postoperative day #3. atthis point , the patient's vac dressing was changed to demonstratea well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulationtissue and no signs of wound necrosis. the patient remained instable condition through postoperative day #7 at which point , shewas returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation anddefinitive closure of her right foot wound. for a detaileddescription of this operative procedure , please see the relevantoperative note. the patient tolerated the procedure well and wassubsequently returned to the regular outpatient floor where sheremained for the duration of her stay. a general overview of thepatient's hospital course by system is as follows:1.

patient was also noted to have significant painassociated with her contracted right lower extremity. for atime , the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extensionbrace which provided some measure of relief; however , uponregular examination of her right lower extremity , it was notedthat she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary tothe extension brace. a neurology and pain service consultationwas obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended forzanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain controldramatically. the patient otherwise remained intact from aneurological perspective for the duration of her stay ,demonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with herbaseline examination.2. cardiovascular: the patient remained stable from acardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with noevidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise. at nopoint did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemiaor infarction.3. pulmonary: the patient remained stable from a pulmonaryperspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence ofacute respiratory decompensation.4. gi: the patient remained stable from a gastrointestinalstandpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to betolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake. upon discharge ,she was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid p.o. intakeand was noted to be independently productive of adequate amountsof stool and flatus.5. gu: as described previously , the patient was admitted with aknown diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. she was continuedon macrobid therapy through 9/8/2004 , at which point thistherapy was discontinued. subsequent follow-up urinalysesdemonstrated no further evidence of urinary tract infection.upon completion of her macrobid antibiotic course , the patient'sfoley catheter was removed and she was noted to be independentlyproductive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of herstay. she at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renalcompromise or electrolyte imbalance.6. heme: the patient remained stable with a stable hematocritfor the duration of her stay. she was started on plavix therapyfollowing her angiogram , on which she remains at the time of herdischarge. dvt prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparinfor the duration of her stay.7. id: as stated above , the patient's operative cultures werenoted to grow coag.-negative staph , sensitive to both vancomycinand keflex. for the majority of her stay , the patient remainedon vancomycin therapy but was transitioned to keflex on1/11/2004 , on which she remained for the duration of her stay.at the time of discharge , the patient has been instructed tocomplete an additional 10-day course of keflex therapy. of note ,the patient remained afebrile with a stable white count for theduration of her stay and her wound exam demonstrated no evidenceof further infection at the ulcer site.8. endocrine: the patient maintained adequately well-controlledblood sugars for the duration of her stay with no evidence ofacute endocrinological compromise. the patient was subsequentlycleared for discharge to a

m.d.history of present illness: this is a 90+-year-old man withmultiple medical problems , who was recently admitted for a deltams and found to have multiple posterior circulation infarcts ,likely embolic in nature. he was discharged yesterday and nowpresents with fevers , chills , shaking , and increasing abdominaldistention. on admission also , noted to have increased sputumproduction and therefore question aspiration event was consideredwhile at rehab. at his recent hospital stay , he was evaluatedfor pfo , which was found to be negative , had no paroxysmal atrialfibrillation , had hypertensive episodes to systolic bloodpressure of 240 , which responded well to hydralazine. had atroponin leak to peak of 1.94 , which trended down and wasconsidered to be demand related. at baseline , the patient liveswith his wife at home , walks with a walker , and requiresassistance with adls. on arrival on the floor , the patient had atemperature of 101.3 , axillary , heart rate 80s to 90s , bloodpressure 180s/80s , and o2 saturation of 97% on three liters. hisabdomen was found to be quite distended , however not rigid andhad no peritoneal signs.past medical history:1. right hip fracture status post right hemiarthroplasty.2. non insulin-dependent diabetes.3. depression.4. psoriasis.5. leiomyoma.6. hypertension.7. svt.8. history of gi bleed.9. chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.3to 1.6.10. embolic stroke in october of 2006.important studies:1. chest pa and lateral dated 1/10/06 , increased opacificationseen on the lateral view over the lung base concerning forpneumonia , which is probably in the left lower lobe , atelectasiswas seen in the right lung , tiny bilateral pleural effusions arepossible , and heart size is normal.2. abdominal ultrasound on 3/1/06 : 1 ) contracted gallbladderwith gallstones. no sonographic evidence for acutecholecystitis. 2 ) bilateral pleural effusions.3. kub dated 4/5/06 , no subdiaphragmatic air is seen , nohigh-grade obstruction , and limited study due to motion artifact.4. urine culture on 4/5/06 , greater than 100 , 000 pansensitivee. coli.hospital course:1. the patient was found to have a pansensitive e. coli uti and aquestionable left lower lobe pneumonia , which would have likelybeen due to aspiration given the patient's recent stroke anddocumented aspiration by speech and swallow on previousadmission. the patient's white count , which was initially 19.8on the day of admission trended down over the first three days ofhis admission as he was treated with levaquin. the levaquin ,which will cover both the urinary tract infection and thepossibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a totalof a 14-day course to end on 11/16/06. the patient's bloodcultures showed no growth.2. gu , the patient was found to have 1.5 ml of urine in hisbladder when he was admitted indicating significant urinaryretention. a foley was placed and the patient drained the urine.the patient was started on flomax to improve his recovery fromthe urethral obstruction. most likely , the patient hasunderlying urinary retention that was exacerbated by his recentfoley placement during his previous admission. then when he wentto rehab without the foley ( note he did void several times priorto discharge from the hospital ). the patient developed urinaryobstruction likely contributing to his urinary tract infectionand requiring readmission. the foley was kept in place untilhospital day four. when the foley was taken out , the patient didnot void at all. a bladder scan ten hours after the foley wastaken out revealed 432 ml of urine in his bladder. a foley wasreplaced in his bladder and urology was consulted. urologyrecommended bladder rest for seven days meaning that the foleyshould be left in place for seven days and then he is to followup with dr. booker randgaard with the foley still in place for avoiding trial within a week after discharge.3. renal , the patient's creatinine at admission was 2.2 , whichis significantly above his baseline. this was attributed toacute renal failure secondary to the urinary obstruction. whenthe foley was placed , his creatinine steadily declined , and onthe day prior to discharge was 1.2 , which is within his normalrange.4. cardiovascular , the patient continued to be hypertensive withsbps greater than 200 , particularly at night. therefore , duringhis hospital course , his blood pressure regimen was titrated upsuch that at the time of discharge , his blood pressure regimen islopressor 50 q.i.d. and norvasc 10 daily. blood pressures during24 hours prior to discharge ranged from 110 to 140/70s and hisheart rate ranged 64 to 82.5. endocrine , the patient was treated with insulin and his p.o.regimen while inhouse and this can be continued at rehab. hewill be discharged on lantus 12 , novolog sliding scale , andtolbutamide 500 daily.6. gi , the patient had a steadily rising alk phos through thecourse of his hospital stay. at admission , it was 206 and itrose to 508. a ggt was drawn and found to also be elevated at119 , therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed ,which showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but noacute cholecystitis. the patient was found to be constipated onthe day prior to discharge and was given a dulcolax suppository ,which had worked in the past.7.

on hospital day one , the patient wascomplaining of abdominal crampiness and feeling nauseated. she hada small amount of emesis. she had spiked a temperature of 101.2.this was felt to still either be consistent with the flu , or ileus.a fever work up was then begun. she had blood cultures that weresent , repeat kub and a repeat cbc. by the afternoon , the patientwas feeling a little bit better.her cbc that was drawn early in the morning , had a white count of10.38 , a hematocrit of 38.4 , and a platelet count of 422. she hada normal amylase at 57 , normal lipase at 15 , normal lft's with analt

patient's fever curve had improved. thecultures that were previously sent were no growth so far and theseremained negative throughout the course of the hospitalization. shewas tolerating clears over the course of the morning. however ,later on in the day , her pain returned , mainly in the right upperquadrant , right lower quadrant. at this point , the decision wasmade to check a ct scan. of note , when the patient was admitted andhad a temperature spike , she was placed on stress post steroidsgiven her history of prednisone. this was maintained throughouther hospitalization.her ct scan showed that there was contrast seen through the smallbowel and colon to the rectum. there was a small section of smallbowel with wall thickening at the paraumbilical level with fluidaround it and no absence of small bowel obstruction. no edema inthe colon , with a small amount of free fluid around the liver andthe pericolic gutters. this raised concern although these findingscould be consistent with small bowl obstruction , to erase concernabout ischemia. however , the patient's exam had improvedremarkably by the morning of the 22 of june her abdomen was soft , withactive bowel sounds and the patient was only mildly tender. giventhat the exam was not quite consistent with the ct readings , otherthings were considered in the differential. of note , the patienthad a couple of loose stools and stool cultures were sent. he doeshave a history of salmonella in the past. these cultures werenegative and included ssyc and c. diff.the concern was raised on the 24 of june that if this was not consistentwith ischemic bowel , that perhaps this was an exacerbation of hervasculitis and could represent vasculitic changes in her smacirculation which had improved because the patient was placed onstress post steroids. an angiogram was performed and the findingswere as followed: the aortoiliac artery and sma were normal inappearance. there was no evidence of microaneurysm , narrowing ordilation. because of these findings , it was felt that this wasnot a picture consistent with vasculitis. she was switched fromher hydrocortisone to her usual prednisone dose of 10 mg. q d onthe 5 of august , the day prior to discharge.the patient did well overnight , tolerated clears in the morning ,and by lunch time , was able to eat a full diet. of note , thepatient the night prior to discharge , had a complaint of some calfpain which was transient in nature. however , although her exam wasunremarkable , lower extremity noninvasives were done and these werenegative. so the patient is being

alt was 16 , ast 72 , alkalinephosphatase 118 , amylase 15 and lipase 33. her ammonia level was45 , albumin 3.2 , total bilirubin 2.4. her hematocrit was 29.1.her inr was 1.4. ekg was normal sinus rhythm. abdominal ct scanshowed that she had no abscess , no obstruction , no acute abdominalprocess.hospital course: 1 ) gastrointestinal: at the time of admission ,it was a confusing picture for increasedabdominal girth , however the ct scan showed that she had verylittle ascites and on examination , little tenderness. therefore ,she got a paracentesis which was negative for spontaneous bacterialperitonitis. the patient was treated with cefotaxime and flagylfor possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , continued on thelactulose and her diuretics. however , the patient much improvedfrom the gastrointestinal standpoint and after resolution of herinfectious picture ( see below ) , the patient was doing incrediblywell with spironolactone and lasix. she has not been able totolerate her beta blocker secondary to hypotension. during herhospitalization , her hematocrit has been stable. agastrointestinal consult was obtained. i appreciate their input.they recommend to follow up with the transplant team. she has anappointment to see the transplant team on july , 2002. at thistime , it is recommended that she begin to get work-up for a livertransplant. however , her hematocrit and her inr remained stablethroughout the hospitalization.2 ) infectious disease: the patient was negative for spontaneousbacterial peritonitis , however on the second day ofhospitalization , she grew out 4/4 bottles with gram positive cocciin pairs which speciated to be streptococcus group b. therefore ,the antibiotics were tailored and she was started on nafcillinintravenously. the patient then had a picc line placed and shewill continue treatment of two weeks with intravenous penicillin.the patient has been doing very well with resolution of hererythema. infectious disease service consult was obtained. iappreciate their input. they suggested two weeks of intravenouspenicillin.3 ) cardiovascular/hematology: given the swelling of the leg , thepatient had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative forclot. otherwise , she remained in normal sinus rhythm and nosymptoms of congestive heart failure.4 ) psychiatry: the patient was very confused , most likelydelirium. psychiatry input was greatly appreciated. anotherreason for her confusion was the fact that she was getting muchbenzodiazepines at her rehabilitation before. she was weaned offher benzodiazepines and started on olanzapine and titrated up astolerated. therefore , we highly recommend avoiding benzodiazepinesin this patient and continue with olanzapine which can take p.r.n.as well as needed.5 ) vascular: vascular surgery followed this patient during herhospitalization and deemed that her splenorenal shunt was workingwell with no evidence of leak.disposition: the patient is sent to rehabilitation for furthertreatment and finishing of her antibiotic course. atthis point , she has requested a new primary care physician and thiswill be myself. i will follow her with an appointment

included lumpectomy and chemotherapy. the patient hadpersistent pancytopenia , which was evaluated in 10/4 with bonemarrow aspirate biopsy , which showed multiple cytogeneticabnormalities with findings consistent with myelodysplasticsyndrome. in 8/14 , she had a nonmyeloblative peripheral bloodstem cell transplant for a match unrelated donor. in 10/18 , shehad lymphocyte infusion. on 5/8 , chimerism study showed 58%donor origin. repeat chimerism on 8/23/05 showed 100%chimerism. the patient prior to admission for two weeks haddiarrhea , watery in nature. she denied sick contacts , had gibiopsy in middle of 5/24 that showed focal colitis , withoutsigns of gvhd. the patient was given prescription for steroidsthree days prior to admission , but did not complete or fill theprescription , was admitted from the clinic with significant skinrash that was consistent with graft versus host disease.past medical history:includes breast cancer in 1/25 , myelodysplastic syndrome ,hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. the patient had isolatedcomplicated migraine headache and has aortic valvular diseasewith aortic insufficiency.allergies:she describes no allergies to medications.social

clear to percussion and auscultation.cardiac exam: there is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heardbest in the aortic area. abdomen is soft and nontender. thereis no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated on clinical exam. she haslarge external hemorrhoids. there is no clubbing , cyanosis , oredema. neurological exam is nonfocal.hospital course:1. oncology: the patient has a history of mds , 11 months statuspost nonmyeloablative transplant. the patient was very slow toengraft and required donor lymphocyte infusion. most recentchimerism studies on 8/23/05 showed a 100% donor origin. thepatient had stage iii skin gvh confirmed by biopsy on 6/15/05.she had moderate improvement response to solu-medrol , which wasstarted on 8/5/05 ( switched to prednisone on 6/11/05 ) andelidel started on 5/22/05. there has been even more improvementin the skin gvh since initiating rapamycin on 8/6gut gvh/diarrhea. gi biopsy done on 5/10/05 showed grade iigraft versus host disease in left transverse colon , grade i graftversus host disease in rectum , with no viral cytopathic changes.the patient had no significant decrease in the amount of stoolswith solu-medrol , marginal response to rapamycin , now with someimprovement status post three doses of ontak. ontak was given on6/17/05 , 9/6/05 , and 10/22/05 without adverse events. thepatient was premedicated with pepcid , steroids , benadryl , andtylenol. the only side effect is marked increase in left upperextremity edema ( see cardiovascular section for more details ).solu-medrol iv was started 2 mg/kg/day , started on 8/5/05 ,changed to 2 mg/kg by mouth oral steroids on 6/13/05. begantapering with steroids at 100 mg b.i.d. on 11/18/05 , decreased to80 mg on 8/20/05 , and down to 60 mg twice daily on 10/24/05.rapamycin was started on 10/10/05 , goal level between 3 and 12.the patient has been therapeutic since initiating therapy. sheremains on gvh diet , coordinating with dietary and kitchen forcorrect menu. she also has been on lactose-restricted diet thathas helped the stool volume as well.2. hematology: the patient with no active bleeding wastransfused for hematocrit less than 26 and platelets less than20. she did have intermittent bright red blood and clots instool , most recently on 10/2/05 and 8/25/05. this wasattributed to have large hemorrhoids that were found oncolonoscopy. she remained hemodynamically stable throughout.3. infectious disease: the patient remained afebrile throughouther hospitalization , maintained on prophylactic medication ofmepron and acyclovir. cytomegalovirus viral load on 2/7/05 ,8/5/05 , 5/10/05 , and 10/10/05 , all negative. cmv viral loadon 9/6/05 was pending at the time of this dictation. thepatient is to remain on acyclovir and mepron once transferred.4. cardiovascular: the patient remained hemodynamically stable ,did not get hypotensive throughout the admission.5. extremities: the patient had left upper extremity swelling ,markedly worsened , starting on tacrolimus , as this is known tocause capillary leak syndrome due to an ultrasound of the leftupper extremity on 11/28/05 , which is negative for dvt. etiologyis likely due to lymphedema secondary to axillary resection whenthe patient had breast cancer and capillary leak syndromeassociated with ontak. the patient had an echocardiogram toassess the etiology of peripheral edema , which showed an ejectionfraction of 60% , mild aortic insufficiency , and aortic stenosis ,borderline diastolic dysfunction , normal right heart , and minimalpericardial effusion.6. pulmonary: the patient had one episode of dyspnea whenspeaking on 11/16/05 , which resolved without further symptomsthroughout the admission. the patient had chest x-ray on10/6/05 , which showed small left pleural effusion without otherabnormalities.7. gastrointestinal: mouth , the patient had dry mouth , likely acomponent of graft versus host disease using ice chips and mouthcoat is helpful to her. she should continue this throughout.8. gut: the patient had persistent loose stools improved ( seeoncology section ). clostridium difficile testing sent on8/26/05 and 3/5/05 were negative. she had intermittent brightred blood per rectum that was related to external hemorrhoids , asstated above in gi section.colonoscopy on 5/10/05 revealed stage ii gvhd on biopsy with nogross visual evidence of bleed. as the fact now , the patient wasadmitted on 7/16/05 with bright red blood. the colonoscopy wasnotable for large hemorrhagic mucosa , intubating internalhemorrhoids , and at that time biopsies were negative for graftversus host disease. this was on 3/5/05. liver transaminitison 8/29/05 , likely due to ontak would be followed as anoutpatient. the patient also had transient lft abnormalitieswhen first admitted and has since resolved since discontinuingbactrim. the bilirubin remained normal. the patient wasasymptomatic.9. rectum: the patient had anusol as needed for hemorrhoids.she was not a candidate for surgical intervention due toimmunosuppression and infection risk.10. renal: the patient repeated increasing creatinine to 1.3.she maintained a level of 0.9 to 1.2 throughout the last fewweeks before discharge.11. fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: the patient has markedperipheral edema. diureses worked well. the patient was up to18 kg above admit weight and now she is only 3 kg up from theadmit weight on 10/24/05. she is on lasix 40 mg twice daily bymouth. this is likely secondary to combination to venousinsufficiency , steroids , and low albumin. in the setting ofontak , she was given albumin and lasix three times daily , whichis no longer needed now that she that would not be pursuing ontaktherapy until an outpatient attending decides , otherwise. sheshould have a goal i/o negative to 1 to 1.5 liters a day.monitor hemodynamics closely if the patient has been noted to bedehydrated. encouraged ambulation and for elevation we wereusing ace bandage like wraps. the patient had electrolytesmonitored and repleaded as needed. nutrition was following.12. endocrine: the patient's fingerstick blood sugars were 134and 163 , improved since steroids taper initiated. she remainedon the sliding scale as needed , likely this is due to steroids.13. dermatology: the patient upon admission had significantinvolvement of skin due to gvh greater than 80% body surface areainvolved. it is improved significantly , as the exam revealedless erythema , darkening rash , and decreased distribution. thepatient is on gvh medication , as stated in oncology section. shealso came in with macerated areas under both breast and wastreated with miconazole powder and had improved by the day ofdischarge.14. access: the patient had double lumen hickman catheter ,which is erythematous surrounding exit site. the cuff has beenexposed for months , although the patient has had no fevers , nottender , outpatient attending requested to keep it lying in.social disposition:the patient accepted at dwan uoswe chehamp hospital center we had familymeeting on 8/20/05 with all siblings and patient's son agreed ononce the patient is at home , need for increased support ,medication

system:1. ortho: right knee replacement. the patient underwent anuncomplicated right knee replacement on admission. subsequentlyher leg was immobilized as per orthopedic recommendations. thereason for immobilization was that movement of the right lowerextremity might precipitate skin tears.2. skin: the patient incurred a laceration in her left calfperioperatively. she also incurred a skin tear on 11/29/05 withturning in the bed. her skin was noted to be paper thin withunderlying fluid. wound healing was impaired secondary to lowalbumin and chronic steroid use. the patient was seen by theplastic surgery team. this team recommended appropriatedressings for the patient's skin tears. the team also graftedthe left thigh skin tear. the patient was treated withsupplemental vitamins to promote wound healing including vitamina and zinc. she was also treated with antibiotics to preventskin infections. originally she had been on vancomycin for aurinary tract infection and when the course was complete for theurinary tract infection , the patient was switched to keflex forprophylaxis versus skin infections.3. gi: end stage liver disease with varices andthrombocytopenia. the patient's complete metabolic panel andcoags were checked each day. during the course of herhospitalization , the patient's transaminases were relativelystable , but her alkaline phosphatase trended upward. on exam ,the patient had mild right upper quadrant tenderness which shereported was chronic. on 5/13/05 , the patient underwent anabdominal ultrasound to evaluate her right upper quadranttenderness and elevated alk/phos. this study revealed a 2.0 x1.6 x 1.6 cm hyperechoic mass in the portahepatis. this studyalso showed evidence of cirrhosis as well as common bile ductdilation and splenomegaly. a ct scan to further evaluate theportahepatic mass was recommended. for her autoimmune hepatitis ,the patient was continued on prednisone. for her varices , shewas continued on propranolol. her lasix and spironolactone wereheld through much of her hospitalization. on 6/19/05 , her lasixwas restarted in an attempt to remedy her hyponatremia.4. low albumin state: the patient has a low prealbuminsuggestive of decreased po intake versus decreased syntheticfunction of the liver. the patient also has chronic diarrhea andwas thought to be wasting protein. the patient refused ??___??placement for tube feeds. she was initially on a house diet withensure and boost supplements as well as mvi and lactinexgranules. the patient was not taking in adequate calories. on6/19/05 ,

thistesting , too , came back negative. the patient was treatedsymptomatically with imodium.6. gerd: this patient was treated with nexium and p.r.n.maalox.7. dysphagia: the patient reported trouble swallowing. she wasevaluated by the speech and swallow team on 4/6/05. herswallowing function was noted to be intact.8. infectious disease:postoperative prophylaxis: immediately postoperatively , thepatient was initially treated with clindamycin for prophylaxisversus perioperative infection.skin prophylaxis: the patient was initially treated withvancomycin and switched to keflex.urinary tract infection: the patient had a series of dirty ua's.she was ultimately treated with vancomycin for a urine culturethat grew out resistant staph species. she finished her courseof vancomycin on 8/7/05. a repeat ua was noted to be positivefor infection. a repeat urine culture is pending.odynophagia: the patient reported trouble swallowing. she wastreated empirically with fluconazole and clotrimazole foresophageal candida. this treatment did not remedy her pain inswallowing. the patient then developed mouth sores. hsv swabsof these sores are pending. the patient was treatedsymptomatically with viscous lidocaine.9. pulmonary: the patient has a history of interstitial lungdisease and asthma. she was treated with combivent and standingnebulizer treatments. on 8/6/05 , the patient was noted to havea new oxygen requirement of 3 to 4 liters. differentialdiagnosis was pe versus pneumonia versus volume overload. on8/6/05 , the patient had a chest x-ray which showed left lowerlobe atelectasis. a repeat chest x-ray on 10/17/05 was read asnormal. on 7/15/05 , the patient was weaned down to room air.10. neuro:pain: the patient was treated with standing codeine sulfate.nausea: the patient was treated with p.r.n. compazine.11. cardiovascular:pump: the patient has no known heart failure. in terms of hervolume status , she was deemed to be intravascularly depleted asevidenced by prerenal urine electrolytes. she was thought ,however , to be total body volume overloaded. it was thought thatin the setting of her low albumin , she was third-spacing fluid.the patient was intermittently treated with normal saline andspa. on 6/19/05 , normal saline was held and the patient wastreated with spa in conjunction with lasix.rhythm: the patient had normal sinus rhythm. she was monitoredon telemetry.ischemia: the patient has no known history of coronary arterydisease. she had no chest pain. her cardiac markers werenegative. her ekg had nonspecific abnormalities. she wascontinued on her beta-blocker. she was not on an aspirin givenher thrombocytopenia.12. renal: decreased urine output. from the day of admissiononward , the patient had relative oliguria , 500 to 900 cc of urineper day approximately. her creatinine trended downward from avalue of 0.5 on admission down to as low as 0.2. as noted above ,the patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and spaversus spa and lasix.13. hyponatremia: the patient developed asymptomatichyponatremia. this hyponatremia was not responsive to fluidrestriction. on 6/19/05 , the patient was treated with lasix andspa as noted above. tsh , cortisol and uric acid were checked torule out other etiologies of hyponatremia. the results of thesestudies are pending.14. endocrine: the patient has steroid induced diabetes. she wastreated with lantus and sliding scale insulin.15. heme: anemia: the patient had normal iron studies , b12 andfolate.16. thrombocytopenia: the patient's thrombocytopenia is mostlikely secondary to splenic sequestration. an antiplateletfactor 4 test was sent and is pending.17. anticoagulation: the patient had two indications foranticoagulation. the first was right total knee replacement.the second was a right lower extremity superficial femoral dvtdiscovered on 10/16/05. the goal inr for this patient wasdetermined to be 1.5 to 2. it was thought that the patient wasat bleeding risk with a higher inr given her known varices andher thrombocytopenia. from 8/21/05 onward , the patient's inr wassupertherapeutic and her coumadin was held. it was thought thatthe supertherapeutic inr could relate to coumadin effects versusnutritional deficiencies versus worsening of her function.18. musculoskeletal: osteoporosis: the patient was treated withcholecalciferol.19. physical therapy: the patient was followed by the physicaltherapy team.20. access: the patient had a pic line in place.discharge medications , the remainder of the hospital course anddisposition will be dictated by dr. steven

admission , the temperature is 98.6 ,heart rate 70 , respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 133/61 , oxygensaturation was 79% on room air and increased in 94% on 3 l nasalcannula. in general , the patient appeared comfortable withpleasant and convulsant and blind. neck showed a jvp of 7.chest exam was with left basilar crackles no wheezes. heart wasregular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur atthe left upper sternal border. abdomen was soft , nontender , andnondistended with normal bowel sounds. extremities with noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema.laboratory data: on admission were significant for potassium of4.5 , bun of 23 , creatinine 1.6 , which is at her baseline of 1.4to 1.6. white blood cell count of 5.7 , hematocrit 27.3 from abaseline of 26 to 29 ,

an ekg showed q-waveflattening , but no changes from her prior ekgs. normal sinusrhythm.impression: this is an 86-year-old woman with multiple medicalproblems including congestive heart failure , diabetes , andadrenal insufficiency , who presents with recurrent fevers throughlevofloxacin and vancomycin.hospital course:1. infectious disease. initially , the source of her repeatedfevers was unclear. multiple cultures were sent including urinecultures , stool studies , peripheral blood cultures and bloodcultures from the picc sputum cultures and induced sputum withtesting for pcp , given her history of chronic steroid useswithout pcp prophylaxis. all of these came back negative withthe exception of one blood culture from the picc , which grewcoagulase negative staphylococcus aureus. so , the picc line wasdiscontinued and the tip sent for culture , which was negative.after discontinuation of the picc line , the patient did not haveany further fevers. the remainder of her admission , which wasgreater than 72 hours. the induced sputum for pcp was alsonegative and the patient was then started on pcp prophylaxis withmepron ( given her sulfa allergy ) to be continued until she hadcompleted her gradual tapper off of steroids. she completed thelevofloxacin and vancomycin courses , which were started on theprevious admission , for pneumonia and did not have any furtherfevers after completing these antibiotics. a ppd was placed ,which was negative.2. endocrine. the patient has a history of hypothyroidism ,adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroids in the pastand insulin-dependent diabetes. her tsh was checked and wasnormal on admission. so , she was continued on her home dose ofsynthroid. further instructions through her primary careprovider. her hydrocortisone was slightly decreased and her slowtaper will be further directed by her primary care provider afterdischarge. her insulin regimen was up titrated with the additionof the q.a.c. novalog , given her high fingerstick blood glucoses.she should continue on this increased regimen after discharge.3. pulmonary. on admission , the patient was noted to be hypoxicon room air with an oxygen saturation of 79% to 80% , whichincreased to 93% on 2 l to 3 l of nasal cannula. given this newhypoxia and her chronic decreased ambulation , she was sent for act angiogram of the chest , which was negative for pe. the studyalso shows small bilateral pleural effusion and mild pulmonaryedema. resolution of her previous pneumonia and possiblyreactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. given this data , she wasrestarted on lasix with diuresis , titrated to 1 l negative perday and was sound well. given this data , she was restarted onlasix with the diuresis titrated to 1 l negative per day andresponded well. she had decreasing shortness of breath andimproved room air oxygen saturation up to 85% at the time ofdischarge. she is continued to be maintained on oxygen of 2 lnasal cannula with good oxygen saturation and is anticipated tohave a successful gradual wean from oxygen as her diuresiscontinue after discharge. the pulmonary service was consultedand followed her agreeing with the diagnosis of pulmonary edema.they also recommended a followup noncontrast chest ct in 2 to 4weeks after discharge to reevaluate her mediastinallymphadenopathy after a period of diuresis. a followupappointment was made with dr. soucek at the chest clinic atsio sane hospital for two weeks following discharge.pulmonary function test were completed , which showed arestrictive defect , which the pulmonary service felt could beattributed to her volume overload. an echo showed an increasedpulmonary artery systolic pressure at 47 plus the right atrialpressure consistent with previous echo done in september of 2005.thus , this was not considered to be new pathology , nor likelyrelated to her new hypoxia.4. hematologic. the patient has a known diagnosis of irondeficiency anemia as well as anemia of chronic disease and ismaintaining on iron and epoetin as an outpatient. there were nosigns or symptoms of bleeding throughout this admission and shenot required a blood transfusion at any point. she shouldcontinue on her outpatient regimen of iron and epoetin afterdischarge. iron studies done on this admission showed adequateiron repletion with her current regimen.5. cardiovascular. there was no evidence of ischemia throughoutthe admission. given her findings of pulmonary edema on chest ctand her history of diastolic congestive heart failure , she wasstarted on lasix 20 mg iv b.i.d. with effective diuresis noted.this was transitioned to a p.o. regimen of 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,which will be continued after discharge and titrated to herweight loss. she was also continued on her outpatient zocor ,norvasc and lisinopril.6. renal. the patient has a history of chronic renalinsufficiency. she received mucomyst and bicarbonate in her ivfluids , prior to her ct angiogram of the chest with prophylaxisagainst contrast nephropathy. her creatinine remained stable at1.6 for remainder of the admission , which was greater than 72hours. all mediations were appropriately renally dosed. sheshould continue followup with her primary care provider regardingher chronic renal insufficiency in the future.7. fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition. the patient wasmaintained on any iv fluids except as prophylaxis for her ctangiogram. the potassium and magnesium were repeated as neededand she was maintained on the renal , cardiac ada diet.8. prophylaxis: she was maintained on t.i.d. subq heparin fordvt prophylaxis and nexium for gi prophylaxis as well as anaggressive bowel regimen , given her history of chronicconstipation.9. code status: the patient is dnr/dni and her son john durazo , is the healthcare proxy.discharge plan: the patient will be discharged back to mclemens hospital of county to continue physical therapy to regain some independencewith her activities of daily living and more specifically toregain some independence and the activities , which she enjoyssuch as playing the piano. she will have followup with herprimary care provider , dr. pacetti regarding general plan for hercare including gradual hydrocortisone taper , her lasix dosing andher diabetes management. she will also followup at the chestclinic with dr. tobola regarding her pcp prophylaxis

therefore , the planwas to discharge her. on the floor the patient received two gramsof ceftazidime x one and then was taken off of antibiotics.on the afternoon of 29 of july the patient's oxygen saturationsuddenly dropped. she complained of feeling short of breath andnauseous. her room air saturation was 82% when these symptomsfirst developed. over the next 30 minutes the patientdecompensated and her oxygenation was steadily increased; however ,on 100% nonrebreather face mask her oxygen saturation was less than80% and her skin appeared mottled. a portable chest x-ray showedmild congestive heart failure. the patient's ekg showed a normalsinus rhythm , no axis changes and no st changes. the patient hadreceived 100 mg of iv compazine for nausea; otherwise , no newmedications since admission. her temperature was 100.5 at 2:00p.m. because of her rapid decompensation a code green was calledand she was intubated and transferred to the micu. abg showed a phof 7.35 , a pco2 of 44 , and a po2 of 96 following intubation. bloodpressure remained , during this time , at 130 to 200 over 70 to 90with heartrates in the 70's to 90's. during her rapiddecompensation the patient was given nebulizers , but with noeffect. the cause of the patient's sudden decompensation wasunclear. during the period of rapid decompensation the patient gota total of 100 mg of iv lasix. her lung exam showed some crackles ,but she did not appear to be all that wet. a chest x-ray threehours post intubation showed diffuse fluffy infiltrates in thebilateral lung fields , more central than peripheral. no effusionwas noted. based on the findings of this chest x-ray , a vq scanwas not done. it was thought that the rapid decompensation was dueto either pulmonary edema ( the patient had been on 150 cc an hourof iv fluids for approximately 24 hours because she was dehydratedwhen she first came in ) , blood , or pneumonia. the patient wascovered with vancomycin , ceftazidime ( for pseudomonas ) ,levofloxacin ( for legionella ) , and pentamidine ( for pcp ). thepatient was also given 50 mg of iv solu-medrol b.i.d. numerouslaboratory studies were sent off including: rsv , influenza ,parainfluenza , vre , legionella , pcp , adenovirus , acid-fast bacilli ,ch50 , and ana , all of which were negative. urine and bloodcultures were negative as well. cardiogenic pulmonary edema wasthought to be an unlikely cause , given that she had a normal leftventricular size and an ejection fraction of 50% in anechocardiogram done right after being intubated. there was also noevidence of any right ventricular dysfunction or rv strain.she did well over the two days following intubation and wasextubated on 6 of may a bronchoscopy was considered , given thepatient's history of hemoptysis , but as the hemoptysis resolvedover the next couple of days , it was thought to be unnecessary.the patient's oxygen saturation following extubation was 95% onthree liters nasal cannula and continued to be in the mid 90's onceshe was weaned to room air in the subsequent two days. allantibiotics were stopped while the patient was in the micu exceptfor levofloxacin , which was continued for a seven to ten daycourse. the patient was gradually tapered off of the ivsolu-medrol and put on a p.o. prednisone taper starting at 80 mgp.o. q day. the pulmonary consult team saw her when she was backon the floor for her continued hemoptysis , but this appeared toresolve over the next couple of days , and , as a result , it wasdecided that this need not be pursued at the present. the patientdid well over the next several days and the day prior to dischargewas saturating at 94% on room air and received 10 mg of p.o.prednisone. the etiology of the patient's sudden decompensationwas never entirely clarified , but it appeared that flash pulmonaryedema was probably the most likely explanation , possibly due to aviral pneumonia in conjunction with fluid overload.medications on discharge: 1 ) tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.headache. 2 ) premarin 0.625 mg p.o. qday. 3 ) colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4 ) lasix 20 mg p.o. q otherday. 5 ) glucotrol 10 mg p.o. q day. 6 ) synthroid 125 microgramsp.o. q day. 7 ) lithium 300 mg p.o. q day. 8 ) cytotec 400micrograms p.o. t.i.d. 9 ) prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day. 10 )prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. 11 ) inderal 20 mg p.o. q day. 12 )fosamax 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. 13 ) elavil 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.discharge disposition: the patient's discharge disposition is tohome with vna.follow-up plans: the patient is to follow-up with her primarycare doctor , dr. valentine hawf , if her weightincreases by more than two pounds , or if she has any furtherproblems. the patient is also to follow-up with him next week.the patient is also to follow-up with dr. avey from the cardiologygroup , as needed.condition on discharge: the patient's condition on discharge wasstable.dictated by: theodore nash , m.d. gn0attending: tyrell favre , m.d. hs3qe693/1374batch: 91634 index no. tilesr8iy4 d: 6/24/98t: 10/5/98",0

however , he was noted to have alarge postvoid residual of 300 cc. it was felt that this might berelated in part to mild benign prostatic hypertrophy. dr. nydam ,his primary care physician , is aware and will pursue furtherwork-up as necessary.problem #3: ataxia. the patient was noted by the family membersto be somewhat ataxic at home. the onset of thisataxia was in relation to his current illness; however , given thefact that he was on coumadin , and due to the fact that he hadsustained a fall in the evening of admission , a ct scan wasperformed to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. the ct scan wasnegative for hemorrhage and showed age-appropriate atrophy. aneurology consult was also requested , and recommendations for thect scan , as already discussed , were made. in addition , theyrecommended that we check an rpr , b12 , folate , and tsh. theresults are as follows: rpr was nonreactive. the first draw ofb12 was 233 , which is slightly low normal. a repeat b12 was 564 ,which is within normal limits. his folate was normal at 4.9. histsh was slightly low at 0.44. a physical therapy consult was alsoobtained to assist the patient with exercises to improve hisstrength. by discharge , the patient was able to ambulate withoutdifficulty. he was having no ataxia , whatsoever. we feel , inpart , that some of this ataxia may have been related to generalizedweakness that was associated with his current illness.problem #4: diabetes mellitus. on admission , the patient'sglucose was 194. due to his oral intake , we electedto hold his glyburide and to give him insulin subcu. on a slidingscale basis as needed. by hospital day #4 , the patient's p.o.intake had improved , and we resumed glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. daywith sliding scale p.r.n. we continued accucheks on a b.i.d.basis. his glucose tended to run in the low 200s. his glucosewill need to be followed as an outpatient , and perhaps one mightconsider a glucometer for him at home to ensure that he has goodglucose control.problem #5: hematologic. the patient was admitted on coumadin ,which he takes as follows: 2.5 mg. alternating with3 mg. on admission , his inr was 1.8. his inr was rechecked on6/2/95 and was noted to be 4.8. his coumadin was held for a coupleof days , and his inr was rechecked on the day of discharge; it was2.4 on the day of discharge. we feel that the elevation in his inrwas probably related to his being on antibiotics. i have mentionedthis to his primary care doctor , dr. reimer he will follow up onhis clinic visit on monday , 7/22/95.laboratory pending on discharge: legionella antigen , obtained on10/2/95. repeat stool forclostridium difficile toxin on 1/5/95 ;

failure regimen wastitrated. the patient continues on isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. andhydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for after load reduction. he wasrestarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. aswell as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. the patient wasaggressively diuresed with intravenous lasix and zaroxolynfollowed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at thetime of discharge. the patient will be followed by dr. rayford hogenmiller in the clevesa irvca sideenandri as well as by thechf service at sher-ship rimark's medical center . at the time ofdischarge , the patient was felt to be nearing euvolemia withestimated dry weight of approximately 76 to 77 kg.3. rhythm: the patient continued to have atrial flutter with ablock. his heart rate remained in the rate of 100 to 110 at thetime of discharge. he had decreased episodes of more rapiddysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to hismedication regimen. he also continues on amiodarone at 200 mgp.o. q.d. as mentioned , the patient was found to have atrialclot on transesophageal echocardiogram and thus was started on aheparin drip and transitioned on coumadin. however , after asubstantial discussion with the congestive heart failure serviceand the patient's outpatient chf care team , it was felt that therisks of coumadin in this patient who has a history ofsignificant noncompliance were greater than the known risk ofthromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clotand thus the patient was not continued on coumadinanticoagulation. rather , he was given aspirin and plavix at fulldoses. the use of coumadin in this patient could be re-evaluatedas an outpatient based on the patient's follow-up as deemedappropriate by his outpatient providers.4. endocrine: the patient remained on stable diabetes mellitusregimen of lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing novolog 3 unitsq.a.c. as well as the novolog sliding scale. the patient'sinsulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possiblyoral diabetes medications restarted.5. pulmonary: the patient remained stable from the pulmonarywith good oxygen saturations on room air at rest and withambulation.6. renal: the patient's creatinine on the day prior todischarge was 1.6 improved from the peak of greater than 2.renal toxic medications were avoided. the patient had not beenrestarted on ace inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatientas his renal function stabilizes. his electrolytes weremonitored and repleted aggressively.7. hematology: as mentioned , the decision was made not toanticoagulate the patient with outpatient coumadin. he wasstarted on aspirin and plavix. of note , the patient also haddecreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation andthus anti-p4 antibody was sent. this test is pending at the timeof the dictation , but should be followed up by the patient'soutpatient providers as it may input further treatment. in themeantime , recommend no heparin products. as mentioned , thedecision was made by the chf team who will be following thepatient as an outpatient not to continue coumadinanticoagulation.8. neuro: of note , on the evening of 5/2/05 , the patientcomplained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for thepatient. he does have chronic right visual changes. in light ofthe patient's known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrialclot , the patient was seen by the stroke team for a question ofacute stroke. he had mri at that time , which did show multipleold infarcts in the right frontal , right occipital , leftoccipitoparietal , left posterior frontal areas. there was ,however , no new stroke seen on the mri. the left internalcarotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the mri andthere was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versusstenosis. the patient declined any procedure such as carotidendarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotidstenosis and due to this denial no workup with the cta was done.it was felt that because the patient would decline anyintervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acuterenal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study.the patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries onseveral occasions. a carotid noninvasives were ordered and arepending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity ofdisease.9. social: the patient's sister , alexis fernendez , is his health careproxy. the patient in her presence has declined coronary arterybypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation. the patient hasalso declined further procedure for his probable carotid arterystenosis.10. disposition: the patient will be discharged to the com medical center for further rehabilitation. he will follow up with dr.kyle yandle in the t las on 8/23/05 at 08:30 a.m. as wellas with dr. clyde chatampaya of elmert hospitalcardiology 10/25/05. he also has a follow-up appointment

supplements ,however , she continued to be nauseated and unable to take goodp.o. gi was consulted regarding possible stenting of heresophagus given that she had an intra-esophageal lesion thatcould potentially be causing this nausea. she was also orderedfor a barium swallow. on the barium swallow , there was a strictstenotic lesion of the esophagus , which is not allowed any foodto pass through. an egd was performed , which showed some foodabout a tight stenosis that was unable to be passed. based uponthis it was felt that she would benefit from a g-tube.interventional radiology was consulted and placed a g-tubewithout complication. tube feeds were begun and she toleratedthem well without complication. she has been continued on tubefeeds and is currently at goal of 360 cc four times a day , with ascoop of promod , these will be continued upon discharge.2. tia/cva: on the evening of 5/24/05 , it was noted that shehad decreased ability to move the left side of her body. basedupon this , a stat ct and cta was performed. the ct showed nobleeding , and during the ct scan , she regained all function inthe left side , however , the cta did note a large friable clotwithin her right ica. based upon her high level of heart diseaseand high risk for an operative procedure , it was not felt thatshe would be a stent candidate at that time. she was continuedon lovenox therapy with coumadin with the plan to discharge heron medical management for this tia. however , on the morning of8/16/05 , she was noted to have a new left-sided facial droop.she also had some left-sided weakness. a stat ct , cta once againshowed no bleed. at this point , the clot was noted to have movedfrom the right ica into the mca , and to have dissolved somewhat.based upon this , it felt that she would have good recovery fromher stroke , and she was not a candidate for any sort ofintervention at that time. she was converted over to heparindrip with the plan to give her a heparin drip as bridging overwhile her coumadin became therapeutic. she was continued onheparin drip until her inr was therapeutic. she will bedischarged on coumadin and continued on coumadin and aspirintherapy for life.3. esophageal cancer: she was continued on xrt for the entiretime when she was in the hospital. conversations between dr.depaoli , dr. serl and the family were had and it was felt that shewas no longer a chemotherapy candidate given her poor status , interms of her other issues. she will be continued on xrt afterdischarge from the hospital.4. acute renal failure: on admission , she was noted to have anincreased creatinine; it was felt to be most likely due todehydration. however , at the time of admission , she had a bun of50% and a renal ultrasound was performed , the renal ultrasoundwas normal and showed no further defect over the course of herhospital stay. her creatinine continued trending down and was0.9 on the day prior to discharge.5. cad: she has a history of chf with an ef of 50%. she wasmonitored on tele for arrhythmia and no arrhythmia was observed.she does of note have a right bundle branch block at baseline aswell as biventricular pacer with 1 lead out of place causing

while she was being hydrated , however , it wasrestarted after the g-tube was placed and she was gettingsufficient feeds. she was also continued on her statin. she hadno other cardiac issues while she was in the hospital.6. nausea: she was treated with zofran for her nausea when shewas admitted and she continued to have good response to this.7. urinary tract infection: on the 25 of may she noted that she washaving increasing pain on urination and increasing burning , an uawas done and it was found to be positive for infection. aculture was performed , which showed enterobacter that waslevo-sensitive. she was started on levaquin and the foley , whichhad been placed prior was discontinued. she was continued onlevaquin for a 10-day course and this will be continued forseveral days after discharge.8. hypothyroidism: she was continued on her synthroid at herhome dosages while she was in-house.9. gerd: she was continued on prevacid while she was in-house.10. a-fib: she was continued on coumadin , although it was heldprior to her egd and g-tube placement. during the time when shewas not therapeutic on her coumadin she was treated with eitherlovenox subcu. or heparin iv drip titrated to a ptt of 60 to 80 ,therefore she was always therapeutic on her anticoagulin duringthis hospital stay.11. she was initially on a full diet , however , she was unable totake any p.o. so she was started on tube feeds , which she wasable to make her goal. nutrition was involved in her care andshe was continued on multivitamin.12. she was on lovenox or heparin drip throughout herhospitalization for dvt prophylaxis. she was also continued onprevacid.code status: full code , and remained full code throughout herhospitalization.communication: there was much communication

developed increased dyspnea onexertion , shortness of breath , especially with walking in themorning. there was a question of light-headedness. he denied anychest pain , pressure , or tightness. no jaw , neck or arm symptoms.no orthopnea or pnd. her also denied visual symptoms or headache.one day prior to admission the patient was taking a walk and was sofatigued that he had to stop. on the day

quit smoking tobacco approximately 40years ago. occasional alcohol use.family history: his brother had a heart attack in his late 50s.the brother also has diabetes.physical examination: vital signs: temperature 98 , blood pressure190/98 , pulse 48. o2 saturation was 98% ontwo liters by nasal cannula. general: the patient is an elderlyafrican-american gentleman , sitting up in bed in no acute distress ,talking in complete sentences. heent: the left eye has anonreactive pupil. the right eye has a small pupil , approximately2 mm , with a clear cataract. there is no icterus. the oropharynxwas clear with gingival hypertrophy. neck: supple , with fullrange of motion. there was no lymphadenopathy. jvp was difficultto assess because of the large neck. cardiac: regular rate andrhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base. the carotids werewithout bruits. pulmonary: the patient had bibasilar rales withexpiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. abdomen:protuberant , soft , non-tender. normoactive bowel sounds. noorgans appreciated. extremities: edema 2+. femoral pulses were2+. there were bruits. distal pulses were intact. rectal: thepatient was heme-negative.diagnostic

16. admission ck was 175.troponin i was 0.05. chest x-ray showed a questionable bibasilarinfiltrates. ekg showed sinus bradycardia at 56. the axis was 20degrees. the intervals were 0.175/10/96/0.471. there was lvh byvoltage criteria , an isolated q in lead 3 , biphasic t waves in avl ,and a flat t in lead 3.hospital course: by problems:congestive heart failure: the patient underwent a rule outmyocardial infarction protocol and subsequently did rule out.after that he had an exercise echo. the patient exercised forthree minutes on a modified bruce , achieving a maximum heart rateof 97 and a blood pressure of 160. the test was stopped because ofknee pain and shortness of breath. baseline images prior toexercise showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy , with overallnormal function. there were no resting wall motion abnormalities.stress images obtained after peak exercise showed a suggestion of aposterobasilar hypokinesis. no other wall motion abnormalitieswere noted. it was felt that this findings were questionable fornonspecific finding or ischemia. it was felt that the ekg portionof the ett showed no evidence for ischemia. the patient wasdiuresed gently with iv lasix and his shortness of breath improved.hypertension: on admission , the patient's blood pressure wasapproximately 220/110. the patient was started on iv nitroglycerinand iv labetalol in the emergency department. the patient wassubsequently weaned from iv nitroglycerin and switched to p.o.hydralazine and minoxidil , 100 mg t.i.d. and 2.5 mg q d. ,respectively. the patient had excellent blood pressure control onthese medications. the patient was discharged with close follow-upin order to titrate these medications.anemia: the patient's admission hematocrit was 32.2. subsequenthematocrits were very labile , and there was felt to be some laberror involved. follow-up hematocrit was in the mid 20s. this wasrepeated and was again in the mid 20s. he was transfused two unitsof packed red blood cells and underwent upper endoscopy. thefindings were gastritis , with some small erosions in the antrum anda subcutaneous nodules , which was biopsied. h. pylori studies werepending at discharge , as were biopsy results. the patient wasstarted on prilosec 20 mg q d. and will continue with this forseveral weeks. aspirin was held , as the patient's egd findingswere felt to be consistent with nsaid gastritis. iron studiesobtained were not entirely consistent with iron deficient anemia.the serum iron was low. however , the ferritin and tibc were withinthe normal range. further workup of the patient's anemia will takeplace as an outpatient.chronic renal insufficiency: the patient's creatinine increasedfrom admission value of 2.0 to 2.5. this was felt to be secondaryto diuresis , and the patient's diuretic dose was decreased. thepatient will need to have outpatient follow-up of his creatinine.discharge medications:1. albuterol inhaler two puffs as needed for shortness of breathand wheezing.2. prilosec 20 mg q d.3. symvastatin 10 mg q d.4. nitroglycerin sublingual as needed for chest pain , pressure ortightness.5. aldomet 750 mg t.i.d.6. minoxidil 2.5

is an 83-year-old female with history of insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus , hypertension , pulmonary carcinoid , andcoronary artery disease who presented with weakness and a changein mental status. her son found her at home on the floor. thepatient stated that she fell secondary to weakness. her weaknessand change in mental status had lasted approximately one week.she also complained of dysuria. no chest pain , no shortness ofbreath , no nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. at baseline , thepatient is alert and oriented x3. she lives alone and functionsindependently. in the emergency room , a cat scan of the head wasnegative for acute process. troponin was 0.2 , and therefore shewas started on iv heparin.physical examination on admission:temperature 97.1 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 190/82

blood cell count of 12.3 ,hematocrit was 36.4 , ck of 3499 , and troponin of 0.2. her ekgwas normal sinus rhythm , new 1 mm st depression in leads ii , iii ,and avf. her chest x-ray showed right lower lobe mass , which wasunchanged from her previous x-ray. her head ct was negative.urinalysis on admission showed too numerous to count white bloodcells , plus nitrates , and plus leukocyte esterase.hospital course:this is an 83-year-old with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , andmedically managed b.i.d. who is admitted with change mentalstatus and fall secondary to weakness.1. infectious disease: the patient was found to have a uti ,which is likely the reason for confusion and weakness. she wasstarted on ciprofloxacin. urine cultures were sent and grewklebsiella and citrobacter , which were indeed sensitive tociprofloxacin and she was continued on the ciprofloxacin.2. cardiovascular: ischemia. she had a troponin leak onadmission of 0.2. a b set of cardiac enzymes was negative for , thetroponin level was less than assay. the leak was most likely secondary todemand ischemia in the setting of an infection. a c set of her cardiac enzymeswas negative as well. the heparin was therefore discontinued. thepatient does have a history of coronary artery disease , but isnot a candidate for catheterization per her primary care doctor'snotes. in-house , she was continued on aspirin , statin and abeta-blocker , which was changed during her admission fromlopressor to labetalol for alpha blocking activity as her bloodpressure remained high and blood pressure optimization wasattempted. norvasc was also increased to 10 mg daily andhydralazine was given p.r.n. for blood pressure greater than 140 ,for which she received a few doses. she was also continued onlisinopril and diovan and she was monitored on telemetry. theonly event on telemetry being a short run of svt.3. neurologic: the patient's change in mental status was likelyrelated to urinary tract infection. the head ct on admission wasnegative. her neuro exam was not suggestive of any focaldeficits. her detrol was held during the admission due to itseffect on mental status. her weakness was likely due todeconditioning. she was very weak and had trouble sitting at theedge of the bed or transferring to a chair with physical therapy.she was seen by physical therapy who recommended rehabilitationand 24-hour supervision. the family refused transfer to askilled nursing facility despite the recommendation and theyunderstood the concern and risks. they reportedly planned tosupervise the patient on their own , 24 hours everyday.4. endocrine: the patient has diabetes mellitus , her bloodsugars were low on admission. originally , her nph dose was cutin half. her blood sugars were

was seen in clinic on february , 1996 , by dr.glod , and was admitted for management. she had a myocardialinfarction in 1981 and , in september 1995 , she had a three vessel cabgwhich included a lima graft to the lad and two saphenous veingrafts to the om and to the pda. in april 1995 , her postoperativecourse had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusionwhich required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as athorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication anddrainage of effusions. at this time , she had also been dyspneic onexertion along with shortness of breath at rest. on april , 1995 ,she had an echo which showed an ef of 59% , a mildly dilated leftventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branchblock , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitralcalcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.a bovie study was also performed and was negative. she alsopresented with some biventricular failure and diuresis wasattempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. over the past twomonths , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gainedapproximately 21 lb since february , 1995. she has been quiteactive and not limited. however , the edema has been her mostlimiting factor. three nights prior to admission , she had dyspneaon exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no

roomair. her neck examination was significant for a jugular venouspulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. hercarotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there wasa right cea scar. her chest examination was significant for fewcrackles at bilateral bases. cardiac examination showed a normals1 , s2 , but with a faint s3. abdominal examination had a positivefluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upperquadrant. extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to kneesbilaterally. dp pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses wereunable to be palpated. her weight , at the time of admission , was233 lb.laboratory data: laboratory values were unremarkable at the timeof admission. ekg showed normal sinus rhythm of64 , left bundle branch block

three hospital days , during which she lostapproximately 17 lb. she was then switched to p.o. lasix onhospital day four , and continued to diurese. she was placed onstrict fluid and diet restrictions throughout her stay. her bloodpressure was controlled with a diuretic , as well as with a beta-1blocker and ace inhibitor and a small amount of nitrate. hercalcium blocker was discontinued while we were trying to diureseher. her blood sugars ran low with her normal 35 units of nphdose , so the dose was held for a couple days and she was controlledan czi sliding scale and was resumed on 20 units

syndrome. she was admitted withincreasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain overthe past week prior to admission. she has most likely had afailure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tappedalong with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome interms of recurrent pleural effusions.hospital course: 1. pulmonary. we initially diuresed ms. jowellwith iv lasix , along with diuril. she had briskdiuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. onhospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and wereable to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. the fluid wassent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as anexudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. the cytology wasnegative for any malignant cells. the pulmonary team wasconsulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis toprevent effusions from recurring. we consulted thoracic surgery ,who requested a ct scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungsfor evidence of malignancy.ct scan was done on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and having todo the study without iv contrast , there were areas in her right andleft lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have beenmalignancies. ct surgery also requested cardiac clearance beforeany definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset svt. we obtained astress mibi. on 9/4/01 , she was taken to the operating room for surgeryof the right chest. at that time , dr. women , the cardiothoracicsurgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedlythickened and yellow. she also took a wedge biopsy of the rightlower lobe. those biopsies have returned , and revealed mildnonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis.the diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoidtissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. she had a chest tube placedat the time of operation and tolerated that well. however , after thatprocedure , she was deemed unstable by the pacu team and wasadmitted to micu overnight. she extubated without problems andremained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygensaturations in the 90%. she was readmitted to the medicine teamon the following day , 8/28/01. overall , she tolerated thatprocedure well. her chest tube that was placed on the right sidedid not drain much fluid over the next few days. however , thepleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we dida thoracentesis on 8/28/01. we removed 1 liter of turbid ,yellowish brown fluid. the chemistries revealed a lymphocyte andmacrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at thistime. as her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracicsurgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which hasshown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% ofthe time. the pleurodesis was on 3/29/01. she tolerated thisprocedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48hours. the chest tube was pulled on 6/2/01.mrs. musson 's shortness of breath was much improved after theinitial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on herhome oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. theplan is for her to see dr. colasante in 2 weeks and also have afollow-up chest x-ray. at that time , dr. ostermann will determine ifthere is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis.she can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initialpleurodesis on the left.2. cardiovascular. mrs. blan was tachycardic on admission , andcontinued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. she wasinitially diuresed with iv lasix and diuril , and was probably overdiuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight.on hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates inthe 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. she converted back tonormal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of iv calcium channel blockers anda diltiazem drip. she was then maintained on diltiazem sr 60 mg pob.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinusrhythm. however , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal hltachycardia during her micu admission. at the time of admission ,we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. she had a bedsideechocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed atrace pericardial effusion. she also had a dobutamine mibi forcardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. herheart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreasedfrom 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. the clinical response todobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response wasnormal , and the ekg response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. therewere no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress orrest images. however , only planer images could be obtained , due todifficulty with positioning of the patient's left arm. her resultswere determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence ofhemodynamically secondary cad , although the study was technicallylimited.in terms of her diuresis , ms. duensing was kept on iv lasix for onlythe first few days of her admission , and then was switched to podiuretics. initially at a dose of 200 mg po b.i.d. , and thendecreased to 120 mg po b.i.d. her lower extremity edema decreasedsignificantly , along with her pleural effusions.3. renal. ms. handy 's baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatininethroughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. we caused a mildcontraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete herelectrolytes as needed. she will follow with dr. svinth for herrenal insufficiency as an outpatient.4. endocrine. ms. reppell has type ii diabetes and was on glyburide5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. she continued that therapy as aninpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during thisadmission.5. rheumatology. ms. chad has a history of gout , and we wereconcerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressivediuresis. we continued her colchicine and decreased herallopurinol to 200 mg po q. d. we also continued her vitamin etherapy for the yellow nail syndrome.6. hematology. she has chronic anemia , and we continued her ironand procrit treatment during the admission.disposition: ms. souza will be discharged to home with vnaservices to administer her twice weekly procrit doses , and physicaltherapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion inher joints infected with gout. she has been instructed to makefollow-up appointments with dr. amicone in a few weeks , and to havea chest x-ray on the day that she sees dr. burchell she should alsofollow-up with dr. donkin in the renal clinic.discharge medications: 1. allopurinol 200 mg po

the blood cultures was vre grew backpositive on 1/25/07 , it was certain that the new tunneledcatheter was not the source of vre and the decision was made to treatthrough the line. all subsequent blood cultures from 9/27/07and 2/28/07 are all negative to date. the patient had onetemperature spike to 101 degrees , and she was recultured of thesecultures which were negative. she also had a repeat chest x-raywhich showed only minimal atelectasis and no evidence ofpneumonia. the patient subsequently defervesced. and has been afebrile forover 72 hours. also , of note ,the patient had a history of c. difficile. she was continued on oralvancomycin for suppression. she did continue to have numerousloose stools during the hospitalization and c. difficile cultureswere sent twice on 6/8/07 and again on 3/7/07 , both of whichwere negative. also , of note , the patient has sacral decubitusulcer that was watched closely for infection.2. renal: as noted above , the patient's tunneled catheter wasremoved as it was deemed the most likely source of her fungemia.she was dialyzed once through her temporary femoral line andtunneled catheter was then placed on 3/7/07 and the patient wasdialyzed approximately every two days with the last dialysis on10/11/07 .  the patient is due for hemodialysis on 7/14/07 .3. heme: the patient has a history of anemia that is consistentwith chronic disease. she received 1 unit of packed red cellsduring her hospitalization.4. gastrointestinal: the patient , on admission , had right upperquadrant tenderness with an elevated alkaline phosphatase andggt. a right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and to ruleout biliary obstruction. this study showed a normal liver. agallbladder with a few small stones as well as sludge ,gallbladder wall thickness was normal. there was no sonographicmurphy's sign , and biliary tree was noted to have a dilatedcommon bile duct of 7 mm that was unchanged and distal ducts werenot well seen. the intrahepatic ducts were noted to be normal.the patient's zocor , however , was held in the setting of elevatedlfts. abdominal pain resolved on hospital day 2 and lfts trended to normal.also , of note , the patient had a history of c. difficileas noted above. she continued to have diarrhea although her c.difficile cultures were negative. she was treatedsymptomatically with lomotil. a rectal tube was also placedgiven her diarrhea and increased pain with soiling of ulcer as well as risk ofinfection. rectal tube should be continued in rehab to preventinfection of the sacral ulcers.5. cardiovascular: the patient has a history of paroxysmalatrial fibrillation with rvr and was continued on her lopressor ,amiodarone. she did not have any episodes of rapid ventricularrate , nor any episodes of hemodynamic instability orhypertension.6. neuro: the patient has bilateral lower extremity weaknessand loss of sensation of the right lower extremity likelysequelae of recent cord compression , per neuro notes in themedical record from 11/22/06 .  the patient also had an episode ofacute delirium. as a result , her reglan was discontinued as washer fentanyl patch and her mental status improved although shestill had baseline memory deficits. psychiatry was consulted andrecommended tapering her celexa and cymbalta in the setting ofwaxing and waning mental status. the patient has also beencounseled to avoid oxycodone or any other narcotics for paincontrol and to try to only use tylenol.7. derm: the patient has a sacral as well as right heeldecubitus ulcer. the wound nurse was consulted , and the patientreceived panafil ointment to the sacral ulcers twice daily.sacral wound is to be irrigated with warm saline and then panafilis to be applied to open areas twice daily , and then wound is tobe dressed with dry sterile dressing , all twice a day. thepatient has sutures in place from thoracic spinal fusion.orthopedics was consulted to remove some of the sutures.approximately , 50% of the sutures , however , were not ready tocome out , and the patient should follow up with dr. hans v cumoletti on 1/12/07 for removal of the remaining sutures. thisarea should be evaluated at least daily and dressings changedonce daily with dry sterile dressings.8. vascular: the patient was noted to have oozing at the siteof her old av graft and the right antecubital fossa on 7/25 .  vascularsurgery was consulted and evacuated a hematoma on 7/25 .  this wound is to bedressed with 2 x 2s , soaked to normal saline and is to be changedthree times daily. the patient is to follow up with dr. daron t pogar from vascular surgery in two weeks to evaluate this woundsite.9. psychiatry: the patient had a flat affect and was thought tobe appropriately depressed in past hospitalizations. she wasinitially continued on cymbalta and celexa. psychiatry wasconsulted and felt that the patient was demonstrating somedelirium , but she was currently not depressed and recommended thather cymbalta and celexa be tapered. she is currently in theprocess of being tapered , and this taper should continue as notedin the discharge medication section.10. pain: the patient was initially treated with fentanyl andoxycodone per rehabilitation regimen. her fentanyl patch wasquickly discontinued in the setting of one episode of acutedelirium. her oxycodone was continued and she requiredapproximately 10 mg of oxycodone daily. she , however , has beencounseled to try to wean herself off of oxycodone , and use onlytylenol for pain given propensity to delirium.11. heent: the patient had a history of severe epistaxis. she ,however , has not had any epistaxis during this admission. shewas continued on saline nasal sprays.12. fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: the patient was seenby nutrition consultants. her zinc and vitamin c werediscontinued to avoid copper deficiency. she was started onmegace 400 mg twice daily , and she was placed on a liberal dietto encourage p.o. intake. the patient required some electrolyterepletion including repletion of phosphate and potassium. ofnote , phosphate should not be repleted with neutrophos but withsodium phosphate for phosphates less than 1.5 possiblygiven the potassium load and neutrophos. at time of discharge however patientdid not have iv acess. patient should recieve one dose of neutraphos 1 packetx1 upon arrival to rehab. she should then have a basic metabolic panel checkedon 2/12/07 to ensure her potassium is normal.13. prophylaxis: the patient was continued on subcutaneousheparin as well as a

"096589653 | nmh | 03255061 | | 568888 | 3/10/2000 12:00:00 am | unstable angina , r/o myocardial infarction | signed | dis | admission date: 7/9/2000 report status: signeddischarge date: 4/26/2000admission diagnosis: chest pain of unclear etiology.history of the present illness: ms. veltin is a 72 year old womanwith a past medical historysignificant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertensionwho presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath.she had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercisestress test in 1997 that was positive for ischemic st-t wavechanges. she had a catheterization at that time which revealeddiffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant. in1998 , she developed a left bundle branch on her ekg but it was notclear when exactly this happened. she stated that for the pastyear , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest thatthen progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations. sometimes ,there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or positionand this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the pasttwo to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to threetimes a week and was associated with shortness of breath. two daysprior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went toher left arm and made four of her left fingers numb. she was quiteshort of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet ormedication noncompliance.past medical history: significant also for diabetes for which shetook insulin and checked her sugars at homewhich ran 170 range to 200 range , hypertension , and she hadidiopathic drop attacks. she got these episodes where her legsfell out from under her without warning but she did not loseconsciousness. she had had an mri/mra that showed some diffusesmall vessel disease but the mra was normal.current medications: atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25q.d. , lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and nph 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m.allergies: penicillin caused a rash and intravenous contrast dyecaused hives.social history: she was a retired nurses' aide who retired in1992 , she was a widow , and she had two livingchildren who were grown. she lived alone and took care of hereight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law wholived next door.physical examination: on admission , significant for an elderlyobese african-american woman lying in bed insome mild respiratory distress. her oropharynx was moist , herjugular venous pressure was 12 cm , her lungs had scattered cracklesat the bases , her heart was regular with an s4 , her belly was softand nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectalexamination showed guaiac negative brown stool.laboratory examination: her ekg showed a left bundle branch blockand chest x-ray showed mild pulmonaryedema and kerley b lines. her laboratories on admission were allwithin normal limits. her initial ck was 97 with troponin of 0.01.assessment: in summary , this is a 72 year old woman with multiplecardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain ofunclear etiology. she was admitted for evaluation.hospital course: 1. cardiovascular - she was admitted forcatheterization which showed three vesseldisease , again nonsignificant and not changed from thecatheterization in 1997. she ruled out for a myocardialinfarction. she had an echo which showed some element of diastolicdysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 plus rabut no wall motion abnormalities. it was felt that she had someelement of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bitof pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia. therefore ,while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her bloodpressure regimen was advanced. her heart rate was in the fiftiesto sixties and atenolol 50 b.i.d. was added. she was on a maximumof lisinopril at 40 milligrams so nifedipine extended release wasadded and titrated up to 120 milligrams q.d. where she maintainedsystolic blood pressures in the 160 range nevertheless. this couldbe further titrated as an outpatient.2. for her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximatelyfour liters through admission with lasix at 40 intravenously andwould be discharged on a seven day course of lasix at 20 p.o. q.d.for further diuresis.3. pulmonary - she did have hypoxia on admission to 85% on roomair while lying in bed. this was felt to be out of proportion toher mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought.her d-dymer was greater than 1000 and she then went for a v/q scanwhich was low probability. her lower extremity noninvasives werenegative. she also had a chest ct which showed no interstitiallung disease. she had pulmonary function tests which wereconsistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed fromher pulmonary function tests in 1998. a pulmonary consultation wasobtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along withobesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause ofher hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness ofbreath much improved and she had o2 saturations that were 93% onroom air.4. endocrine - she was maintained on metformin during admissionand also on half of her dose of her normal dose of nph given herdecreased p.o. intake , however , given the fact that she stated thather sugars at home on her regimen of 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. were170 to 200 , she was discharged on this regimen with instructions tocheck her sugar and call her doctor if they were low.disposition: she is discharged in stable condition on january ,2000. she will follow up with dr. nakajima , her primarycare doctor , and in addition , with dr. klang , her cardiologist.discharge medications: atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25q.d. , lisinopril 40 q.d. , nifedipineextended release 120 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , nph 43 q.a.m. and 24q.p.m. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , aspirin 325 q.d. , and lasix 20milligrams p.o. q.d. times seven days.dictated by: victor lietzow , m.d. jn10attending: cory r. lorsung , m.d. qg8qe043/7701batch: 62923 index no. rfco8u6696 d: 7/19t: 7/19",1

chest pain , for rule out myocardialinfarctionsecondary diagnoses: 2. insulin dependent diabetes3. chronic atrial fibrillation4. hypertensionhistory of present illness: the patient is a 60 year old , spanishspeaking woman with multiple cardiacrisk factors who presented complaining of unstable chest pain. thepatient's cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history ,previous history of smoking as well as postmenopausal statesecondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogenreplacement therapy. the patient has a two to three year historyof exertional angina. of note , approximately one year ago shebegan to have substernal chest pain at rest. the patient statesthat currently she is having approximately three episodes a day onaverage. she describes these as substernal chest pressure whichradiates to her bilateral arms as well as her jaw. she denies anyassociated shortness of breath but does occasionally notediaphoresis. she denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations.in september of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram whichshowed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction ofapproximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mildtricuspid regurgitation. since this time she has been followed bydr. maximo bryum in c&o medical center clinic who initiated an antianginal regimenwhich resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. of note thepatient recently stopped taking aspirin. her symptoms thenrecurred. on the 5 of february , 1995 the patient underwent adobutamine mibbe on which she went 6 minutes and 48 secondsreaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82.the test showed 2 mm st depressions diffusely. the mibbe showedmoderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wallischemia. of note , on the morning of admission the patient wasseen by her vna. during her vna's visit the patient began to haveher typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw aswell as shortness of breath. she denied any diaphoresis or nausea.the patient was given three sublingual nitroglycerins after herprimary m.d. was called and her pain resolved after approximately15 minutes. past medical history: remarkable for a 10 yearhistory of insulin dependent diabetes with complications includingneuropathy and

no known drug allergies.physical examination: her heart rate was 58 , blood pressure141/73 , o-2 saturation 97% on 2 liters ,respiratory rate 16 and unlabored. heent exam showed pupils equalround and reactive to light. extraocular movements were intact.oropharynx was clear. mucous membranes were moist. neck wassupple with full range of motion. jugular venous pressure wasdifficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around theneck. carotids were 2+ and without bruits. cardiac exam showed anirregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal s-1 and s-2 , a i/visystolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. abdomen was soft ,nontender , obese with active bowel sounds. extremities showed aright shin scar which was healing well. there was no clubbing orcyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. rectal examinationwas guaiac negative. on neurologic examination the patient wasalert and oriented x 2. cranial

wave inversions were noted in both leads 3 and fand q waves were noted in v-1 through v-3. chest x-ray showed noevidence of infiltrates or effusions. there was borderlinecardiomegaly.hospital course: the patient was admitted to medicine team voone parkway , ainggo ra i , alaska 89772she was ruled out for myocardial infarction withserial ck , mb and ekg's. heparin was initially started given thepossibility that this was unstable angina. the cardiology team wasconsulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization.on further review of her history the cardiology team decided toschedule a cardiac catheterization. this was performed on the 7 of october and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including aright atrial pressure of 15 , an rv pressure of 50/16 with a mean papressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. the coronaryarteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function wasalso assessed as normal. the patient tolerated this procedure welland without complications. given the confluence of her data , twopossible explanations were postulated including either syndrome xor small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. thepatient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization andwas prepared for discharge. also during her hospital course thepatient's insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep herblood sugars in the approximately 200 range.disposition: medications on discharge: enteric coated aspirin 325mg p.o. q.d.; lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; lopid 600 mgp.o. q.d.; insulin nph 100 units sub-q

course by problems:1. cardiovascular pump: initially , the patient's imdur andlabetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poorrenal perfusion. however , on the hospital day #1 without ivhydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. as such ,the patient was restarted on her home imdur on february ,2005. however , her spironolactone continued to be held. inaddition , her torsemide was held. her urine output wasmonitored , revealed that she put out over 2 l on her secondhospital day. as such , the patient was started on home dose ofbeta-blocker toprol-xl 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 aswell as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. the patient'screatinine continued to improve. it was felt that the patientwas achieving good forward systolic flow and then herhypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the130s to 150s on hospital day #2. however , over the course ofhospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluidwith a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. asthe patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and chfexacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be moreaggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. as such , thepatient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continuedto gain weight and retained fluid. as such , the patient waschanged to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of lasix 2 days prior to dischargeand was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 l of netdiureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. she wasdischarged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of lasix and achieves good effectand maintaining adequate blood pressure.2. ischemia: the patient continued her home lipitor and aspirindoses for known coronary artery disease. however , overnight , theevening of august , 2005 , and the morning of february ,2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , butwas restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. therewere no ekg changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,which were excessive , currently negative. she was maintained onaspirin , lipitor , imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin forthe remainder of her admission. she had no further chest painevents.3. rhythm and rate: the patient was ventricularly paced andmaintained on telemetry. she was continued on her amiodarone 200mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this withgood effect. she also continued her coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic ptat 2.8. the patient had no complications or events from herrhythm or rate standpoint.4. renal: the patient's creatinine returned to baseline byhospital day #3. it was felt that her acute and chronic renalfailure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior toadmission and subsequent hypovolemia. the patient had no furtherissues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressivehydration , taking good p.o. on november , 2005 , the patientdeveloped an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associatednausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reportedwas due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,identified by a ct of the abdomen without contrast within thepast year and by ultrasound in 2004. however , given thedislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may berelated to renal colic and as such , a ct of the abdomen stoneprotocol was obtained on november , 2005 , which showed noevidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once againgallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. the patient respondedwell to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution ofher symptoms by august , 2005 , hospital day #3.5. gastrointestinal: the known biliary colic had resolved byaugust , 2005. the patient was continued on p.r.n. codeinep.o. 30 mg q.6h. and tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. thepatient did not require iv morphine , requesting not to usenarcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospitalcourse.6. endocrine: the patient was initially started on her homedose of nph insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. andregular insulin sliding scale. the a.m. fingersticks were low ,ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.this was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospitalsetting. as such , the diabetes service after consultationrecommended decreasing her nph insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. the patient requestedminimal injections during her hospital course and at home. assuch , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as thepatient continued to express preference for twice dailyinjections. the patient achieved goal fingersticks over herhospital course and was discharged on regimen of nph insulin. inaddition , a tsh was obtained during the hospital course whichshowed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her synthroid wasincreased to 150 mcg daily. she will follow up with herendocrinologist to repeat her tsh and hemoglobin a1c.7. fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: the patient was restartedon her k-dur 40 meq q.a.m. and 20 meq q.p.m. for potassium losssecondary to diureses. her electrolytes remained stable overcourse of her hospital stay. she was continued on alow-cholesterol low-fat diet and ada diet.8. infectious disease: the patient had a ua with 8 to 10 whiteblood cells , concerning for possible low-grade uti , especiallygiven her initial presenting symptoms. as such , she was startedon a 3-day course of bactrim , and completed this course. sheremained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and herurine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units ofmixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normallimits over her hospital admission. as such , no further therapywas required.9. the patient was discharged home on january , 2005 , withvna services.plan following discharge:1. to have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin a1c andto repeat her tsh level to

midcircumflex with right dominant circulation. ventriculogramshowed an ejection fraction of 35%. ekg on 4/5/06 showednormal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63. there was poorr-wave progression in the precordial leads and inverted t wavesin leads iii , v5 and v6. chest x-ray on 4/5/06 was consistentwith congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.there is mild chf , bilateral atelectasis.hospital course: the patient was admitted on the day prior toher scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup.on 5/26/06 , she was brought to the operating room where dr.gonzale performed a cabg x3 using the lima to bypass the lad andsaphenous vein graft to bypass the om1 and saphenous vein graftto bypass the pda. the cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. the veinwas harvested from both legs. the patient was transferred to thecardiac surgery intensive care unit after her surgery where she remainedintubated for two days due to poor lungcompliance. she was also hypotensive in the postoperative periodand treated with vasoactive medications. by postoperative day#2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable ,however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and herlopressor was increased. by post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillationwas rate controlled and she was started on coumadin. bypostoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the icu tothe step-down unit. at that point , she was neurologically intactand her pain was well controlled. she was being treated withbeta-blockers and coumadin for afib. from a respiratoryperspective , the patient was being treated with aggressivepulmonary toilet and chest pt. her chest x-ray showed a smallright pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well withsupplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. the patient's diet wasadvanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output.the patient was treated with lasix for postoperative fluidretention. she also was seen by the diabetes management servicethroughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control.on the step-down unit on postoperative day #5 , the patientexperienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 andshe became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after herdiltiazem was increased. she was transferred back to theintensive care unit where she was observed for three more days.during that time , the patient's hemodynamics stabilized althoughshe remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. onpostoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to thestep-down unit where she spent the remaining six days of herhospital stay. the patient's chest x-ray suggested that she wasvolume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated withlasix and zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowlyfrom 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. the diuretics were decreased. a chestultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesisrevealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis andminimal effusion. the focus then became on chest pt , pulmonarytoilet and deep breathing and coughing. the patient continued toambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , thepatient's chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis inthe right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements.from a cardiac perspective in the step-down unit , the patientwas in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for thefinal three days of her hospital stay. the patient had beenstarted on coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation andthis medication should continue at least until she follow up witha cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heartrhythm. by postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinusrhythm with a stable blood pressure. she was oxygenating well onroom air and was ambulating effectively on her own. she had nocomplaints and was ready for discharge to home. on that day , hertemperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm ,blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , o2 saturation 94% onroom air. the patient was seven kilograms below her preoperativeweight.discharge condition: stable.disposition: discharged to home with vna services.discharge diet: a low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat 2100calorie per day , 4 gm sodium per day diet.activity: the patient should be walking as tolerated and elevateher feet with prolonged periods of sitting.followup appointments: the patient should arrange followupappointments with her cardiologist dr. micheal moresco at051-469-9935 in one to two weeks. she should also see elmo renigar , np in the diabetes clinic in one to two weeks. herphone number is 870-378-1192 yezmxafcp 1. finally , the patientshould see her cardiac surgeon , dr. greg mumbower at 869-541-1864in four to six weeks. the patient should arrange her followupappointments as indicated , and upon return home to s rance saph ,she should followup with either her primary care physician orcardiologist who will follow her in the

precipitated by brisk walking or otherforms of exercises. she reports that her daily workout consists ofsome situps three times a day , and also usually a walk. she statesthat two days prior to admission while walking her normal speedtowards the bus station , she developed some right chest walltightness and shortness of breath consistent with her typicalangina. she was in the middle of the

greatgrandchildren. she denies any use of tobacco or denies any use ofalcohol.physical examination: vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9 ,heart rate of 78 , blood pressure 160/90 ,respiratory rate of 20 , with a room air saturation of 93%. ingeneral , obese black female in no apparent distress. heentexamination was perrl , eomi , neck supple , full range of motion , shehad a soft carotid bruit on the left , no bruits on the right , and2+ pulses bilaterally. lungs were clear. cardiovascularexamination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a soft grade1/6 systolic ejection murmur , best heard at the left lower sternalborder. abdomen had positive bowel sounds , non-tender ,nondistended. she was guaiac negative. extremities showed noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 2+ femoral pulses , no bruits. 2+dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. neurologic examinationwas grossly nonfocal.diagnostic studies: ekg on admission showed a heart rate of 73 ,intervals of .164 , .076 , .049 seconds for pr ,qrs , and qtc. axis was 71. no q waves and no acute st or t wavechanges.laboratory examination: sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 ,bicarb 25 , bun and creatinine of 16 and1.3 , glucose of 282. lfts were within normal limits. ck of 213 ,cholesterol 179. other labs showed a tsh of 1.5 , ferritin 181 ,tibc of 226 , troponin i was 0.0 , hematocrit was 39.4 , white count7.15 , platelet count of 348 , 000. coagulation studies were withinnormal limits. urinalysis showed 2-4 wbcs , 3+ bacteria. her urineculture revealed 50 , 000 suspected enteric gram negative rods. thisis a urine culture from 7/24/96. a chest x-ray revealed noinfiltrates.hospital course:1. cardiac: cardiac wise , she ruled out for an mi by enzymes andekg. she underwent a standard bruce protocol ett on 7/10/96. sheexercised for 8 minutes , stopped secondary to fatigue. maximumheart rate was 95 , maximum blood pressure 170/75. she developedtypical angina in her recovery which spontaneously resolved. shehad 1 mm down sloping st segment depressions in ii , iii , f , v4through v6 , which resolved into recovery. these changes weresuggestive of ischemia , but less specific because of her baselinelvh. she subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on7/28/96 , revealing a 40% left main with 90% mid rca , 90% stenosis atthe origin of the pda , 30% mid lad , and 50% om2. she subsequentlyunderwent angioplasty of the rca and the pda lesion on 4/1/96 withsome mild haze at the pda. therefore , recommendations were forheparinization for a 24 hour period. she remained pain freethroughout this hospitalization. the eps service saw her regardingthe issue of syncope. further workup was performed includingcarotid ultrasounds which revealed no significant stenosis ineither of the carotid arteries. she underwent a cardiacechocardiogram on 2/4/96 to rule out evidence of regional wallmotion abnormality that might suggest the possibility of a prior mias a source of potential ectopy. she was noted to have 2+ mitralregurgitation , noted to have an ejection fraction of 74% , and hadno reported regional wall motion abnormality. she also had noarrhythmias while on monitors throughout the hospitalization. theeps service agreed with the thought that the ischemia in the rcaprobably was the most likely etiology of her syncopal episodes withpossible bradycardia during ischemic episodes. they favoredholding off on the eps study. they felt that the revascularizationand follow-up stress testing were the recommended workup for thispatient and recommendations are for follow-up ett in four to sixweeks. her medical regimen was adjusted in the form of increasingher lopressor from 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as herrate and blood pressure tolerated this regimen. she remained painfree throughout the hospitalization. she will have follow-up withher primary m.d.2. diabetes mellitus: her glucose remained under fairly goodcontrol during this hospitalization with her regimen of nph.hemoglobin a1c was checked and is pending at the time of discharge.3. urinary: she was noted to have 3+ bacteria on her urinalysisand 50 , 000 colony forming units on a urine culture of 7/24/96. wewill empirically treat her for a uti with bactrim 1 ds b.i.d. timesthree days.follow-up: follow-up will be with dr. amous she is to have anappointment in one to two weeks. she is also to have afollow-up ett in four to six weeks. she should also have a repeaturine culture in the necton bryin haweir health clinic during her follow-up.discharge medications:

exacerbation.hospital course by system:1. cardiovascular: ischemia: there was concern regarding acuteand subacute silent ischemia given new st-t wave changes inlateral leads on the ekg. the patient was continued on heraspirin as well as statin. she was ruled out for an mi withnegative troponins x 3. she was continued on a low-doseshort-acting beta-blocker ( lopressor ). she was also continued onan ace inhibitor with this switched to captopril as ashort-acting ace inhibitor , which was titrated up as toleratedfor a goal blood pressure of systolic of 120. an adenosine mibiwas performed which was negative for perfusion defects. however ,echo showed global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction.cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workupwith cardiac catheterization. however , the patient refused thecatheterization.rhythm: the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.however , she remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout heradmission. she was monitored by cardiac telemetry with severalepisodes of 6 to 10 beats of nonsustained ventriculartachycardia. her electrolytes were carefully monitored andrepleted as necessary. she remained asymptomatic with the runsof nsvt and was continued on her beta-blocker. given her historyof atrial fibrillation as well as depressed ejection fraction ,she was restarted on coumadin.pump: the patient presented with a frank fluid overload withelevated jvp , lower extremity edema , and a bnp greater thanassay. she was aggressively diuresed with a goal of greater than-2 liters a day. she responded to 80 mg of iv lasix t.i.d. hercreatinine was carefully followed and did increase on 11/26/03 ,at which point diuresis was put on hold. the patient diuresedabout 3 to 4 liters each day during her hospital stay until7/7/03. at this point , she was thought to be very close toeuvolemic.given the patient's echo findings with depressed ejectionfraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilatedcardiomyopathy was begun. the patient did not wish for furtherinvestigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac mri. herother labs were unremarkable including a tsh , which was normal ,an ana which was negative , iron studies which did not show ironoverload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of thisdictation. the patient will require close followup with carefulfluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestiveheart failure service.pulmonary: she initially presented with shortness of breath.however , this resolved with diuresis. she has a history of pe aswell as dvt and an elevated dimer was found on admission. therewas initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution ofsymptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive ofpulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiralchest ct.heme: the patient's hematocrit was followed. the patient haschronic folate and iron-deficiency anemia and she was continuedon folate and iron replacement.endocrine: the patient was continued on nph 20 units for herknown diabetes. her blood sugars were in excellent control onthis regimen. avandia was held given it contraindication inheart failure.renal: the patient's creatinine was 1.6 on admission , which is upfrom about 0.8 in october of 2003. her urine eosinophils andsediment were unremarkable , but frank proteinuria was noted whichis consistent with her known nephrotic syndrome. her creatinineremained stable in the 1.5 to 1.6 range until 11/26/03 , when hercreatinine bumped to 2 and kept rising until 1/28/03 , when itreached 2.7. repeat urine electrolytes , urine eosinophils andsediment were sent at this point and they are pending at the timeof this dictation. the most likely explanation for increasingcreatinine was aggressive diuresis and intravascular volumedepletion. diuresis was put on hold on 11/2/03 and 10/10/03.given her increased creatinine , her ace inhibitor dose was halfedon 10/10/03. the plan is to continue to monitor her creatininefunction , follow up on her urine chemistries and if hercreatinine resolves , to resume gentle diuresis as necessary.infectious disease: the patient was found to have a uti with e.coli that was sensitive to bactrim and she was treated withbactrim with resolution.rheumatological: the patient with known chronic pain as well asarthritis. her celebrex was held

allergy to lisinopril withreaction of elevated creatinine at a low dose. to levofloxacin ,she has reflux and celecoxib gives her dizziness and elevatedcreatinine.brief admission physical examination:she had a temperature of 101 , pulse of 106 , blood pressure172/71 , oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. she was alert andoriented x3 , in mild distress. her lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. her heart had a regular rate andrhythm with a 2/6 early systolic murmur at the left lower sternalborder. she was obese , but had a nontender , nondistended abdomenwith normal abdominal bowel sounds. she was guaiac negative , andher left foot was in a cast.pertinent laboratory tests and results:she had a sodium of 127 , corrected to 131 with her glucose ,potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of 27 , bun 95 , creatinine 4.5 ,glucose 329. lfts were normal , amylase 19 , lipase 8 , negativeketo acids in the serum and urine. her white blood count was26.8 , inr was 1.4 , ptt was 36.6. she had a dirty urinalysis.she had an abdominal ct that showed a non-incarcerated hernia , noevidence of colitis.operations and procedures:the patient had a debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06. shealso had hemodialysis initiated on 10/9/06.hospital course by systems:1. infectious disease: the patient's left foot was encasted byorthopedics surgery on 2/29/06 with evidence of underlyinginfection. her wound cultures grew mrsa with probes to the bone.x-rays were unrevealing and mri showed severe osteomyelitis. inaddition , the patient had an esr of 109. the patient was thusput on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and flagyl. blood cultures from6/16/06 additionally grew gram-positive cocci in clusters whicheventually yielded mrsa. however , surveillance cultures withtreatment on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and flagyl were negative.the patient received debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06.in the or , the bone looked necrotic and infected. the bone wassent to pathology and microbiology , the results of which arepending. given the appearance of her bone during debridement , itis presumed that the patient will need eight weeks of vancomycin.because she did have a clear source of fevers after it was foundthat she had osteomyelitis , the patient was discontinued offflagyl and levofloxacin on 5/6/06.2. gi: the patient has abdominal pain with gastric emptyingstudy on 6/16/06 showing 0% clearance at 90 minutes consistentwith severe gastroparesis versus obstruction. radiology did notfeel that an upper gi series would give further informationregarding obstruction and it was judged to be unlikely given thatthe patient has bowel movements and rare emesis. later on in thehospital course , the patient was put on erythromycin with adecrease in her symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting.the patient did have any evidence of bowel ischemia on mra.later , erythromycin was changed to reglan on 4/8/06 per renalrequest during hemodialysis. there is no evidence of pancreatisor liver disease and the patient was also kept on compazine fornausea.3. renal: the patient had , on admission , acute on chronic renalfailure. there was a concern for prerenal azotemia in thesetting of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea. she had afractional excretion of sodium which was 0.3% , but it wasdifficult to interpret in the setting of end-stage renal disease.lasix and cozaar were held. however , the creatinine continuedto worsen reaching 6.1 on 9/14/06. renal was consultedregarding the need for dialysis. on admission , the patient didhave matured av fistula graft and she was thus started onhemodialysis on 10/9/06.4. hematology: the patient had an inr which was elevated.hematocrit was also decreased to 25.5 from 34. she was guaiacnegative and did have any schistocyte. her ldh was also normalwith her haptoglobin high. it was judged from her iron studiesthat the patient was iron deficient. she was put on ironsupplementation. she also was felt to have renal component toher anemia and she was started on darbepoetin initially andchanged to erythropoietin later during dialysis by renal.5. cardiovascular: the patient was maintained on aspirin , astatin , and calcium channel blocker. she started prophylacticbeta-blocker during her hospital course as well.6. endocrine: the patient had hemoglobin a1c of 7.8. she wastransitioned to nph and aspart during her hospital stay. she hadintermittent problems with hypoglycemia in the setting of beingnpo pending operations and procedures; however , her insulinregimen was titrated to good glycemic response.7. prophylaxis: the patient was kept on heparin and nexium.8. fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: her iv fluids werestopped as the patient was oliguric and anuric initially beforehemodialysis. later on , she was also put on 1500 ml fluidrestriction. later on during dialysis , her volume statusresolved euvolemia. she was kept on a low fat and

aortic stenosis , cadstatus post cabg , chf , atrial fibrillation with a slowventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation witha fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures withconcerns for endocarditis given his recent avr. the patient wasinitially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.blood cultures were obtained and the patient grew outtwo out of two bottles of gemella morbillorum from his blood.urinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000colonies of pseudomonas aeruginosa. cultures were also takenfrom the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare mrsa ,few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. once bloodcultures for gemella morbillorum returned , the patient'santibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on7/17/07 .  ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. thepatient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit anysignificant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics haveremained negative to date. a tte was obtained and was negativefor any valvular vegetation. however , given the patient's highrisk for endocarditis , a tee was obtained , which was alsonegative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. thepatient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his highrisk.1. cardiovascular:ischemia: the patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness orchest discomfort. he does have a history cad status post cabgand was continued on his full strength aspirin. he was alsocontinued on statin.pump: the patient was volume overloaded at the time of admissionand was treated with 60 mg of iv lasix. following this , heappeared euvolemic and lasix was held for several days and thengradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of ivlasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. qam. at thetime of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , butdiuresing well with 80 mg daily. the patient's losartan was heldin the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiationof gentamicin therapy. at the time of discharge , his weight is96.6 kg. his i/o goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. he shouldcontinue daily weights. of note , the patient's dry weight isapproximately 93 kg. pt's lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.rhythm: the patient is bradycardic at baseline down into themid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refusedpermanent pacemaker placement. all nodal agents should beavoided for this reason. the patient did have several runs ofnonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. electrolyteswere checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassiumabove 4. however , no other medical management was initiatedgiven his bradycardia.2. infectious disease: as noted above , there was high suspicionfor endocarditis in this with a recent avr. he was found to havegemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted aboveempirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed togentamicin and ceftriaxone on 7/17/07 once gram-positive cocciwere speciated. the patient was initially treated forpseudomonal uti with five days of ceftazidime , but given thatonly 10000 cfus grew out , it was decided that ceftazidimecould be discontinued and that there would be some response toceftriaxone plus gentamicin. a picc line was placed on 7/17/07for continued iv antibiotics and the patient should continue afull six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-weekcourse of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despiteboth negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogramgiven his high risk for endocarditis.3. gi: the

copdexacerbation in the setting of likely pneumonia with acute onchronic renal failure and hyperkalemia that has resolved sincehis admission.hospital course by problem:1. pulmonary: the patient was kept on prednisone 60 mg p.o.daily for the first several days of his floor admission and hewas continued on duoneb q.6 h. , albuterol labs were added q.6 h.staggered with duoneb such that he was receiving nebulizertreatments every three hours. he was continued on chest pt. thepatient was started on cpap overnight for history of obstructivesleep apnea. he had not been compliant with cpap as anoutpatient. advair was continued. the patient did well withthis regimen and his oxygen requirements were titrated from 5liters to 2.5 liters at the time of discharge. at this level ofoxygen he was satting in the low to mid 90s with ambulatory satof approximately 90%. the importance of continuing use of homeoxygen both during the day and at night was discussed at lengthwith the patient , though he continued to complain that he haddifficulty going about his daily activities wearing his oxygen. prednisonewas slowly tapered and at the time of discharge the patient wastaking 40 mg of prednisone per day. he will take 20 mg startingthe first day after his discharge and will complete a slowapproximately 2-week taper. his home dose of lasix wascontinued. the patient was not felt to be clinically volumeoverloaded. however , he auto-diuresed 1-2 liters the majorityof the days he was admitted to the floor. followup was arrangedwith the patient's primary care provider and his pulmonologistdr. gering . the possibility of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitationwas discussed at length with the patient and his wife who wereextremely resistant to any other inpatient care. he is thereforedischarged with home vna , though the possibility of inpatient vs outpatientpulmonary rehabilitation should be considered at his followup.2. renal: the patient's creatinine trended down throughout histime on the floor. this happened in the setting of continuedauto-diuresis , suggesting that his initial renal failure was dueto a low flow state as result of heart failure rather thanhypovolemia. at the time of discharge his creatinine was 1.3.he was followed by the renal team during his admission. his arbwas initially held but then restarted upon improvement of hiscreatinine. per renal , his elevated bun in the range of 200 wasfelt to be secondary to steroid use. this had normalized by thetime of discharge. the patient was worked up for a possible avfistula or graft placement in the left upper extremity in thenear future. he will follow up with vascular surgery as anoutpatient for vein mapping as an outpatient. he should not receive blooddraws in the left upper extremity of avoidable.3. infectious disease: the patient was continued on vancomycinand levaquin for a seven-day course. he completed this courseduring this hospitalization and he discharged off antibiotics.all cultures were no growth at the time of discharge.4. cardiovascular: he was continued on aspirin andanti-lipidemics. his lopressor was titrated for hypertension andhe is discharged on 300 mg of toprol per day the rest of hisantihypertensive medicines have not changed. he was kept on teleduring his admission and did have occasional episodes of nsvtusually triplets or couplets. these were asymptomatic.5. endocrine: mr. vitro insulin requirements increaseddramatically during his icu admission , likely as a result ofsteroid use and stress. his insulin requirements fell to theirpreadmission levels during his admission on the floor.6. prophylaxis: he was maintained on heparin and proton pumpinhibitor.code status: the patient is full code.physical exam on discharge: he is in no apparent distress.heart , regular rate

on adiagnostic paracentesis , which showed greater than 250neutrophils. during that admission , the patient was treated fora urinary tract infection and the sbp and was sent home on acourse of oral cefpodoxime. of note , during that previousadmission , the patient was also hyperglycemic and was dischargedon an insulin regimen of lantus 90 with good aspartate slidingscale. at home , the patient's blood pressures were in the 200 to300s and at times even higher. over the week prior to admission ,it was noted that the patient gained somewhere from about 8 to 10pounds with increasing abdominal girth and lower extremity edema.as noted above , the patient's fingersticks were noted to beelevated in the 300s and so her lantus was titrated from 90 unitsdaily to 100 units by the visiting nurse. the patient waspreviously discharged on lasix 40 mg twice daily , which wastitrated up to 80 mg twice daily also by the visiting nurse andher primary care physician. the patient had no additionalshortness of breath , and her oxygen sat was unchanged on her homedose of o2. she had no chest pain , no cough , and no fevers. nonausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. the patient had finished a 7-daycourse of cefpodoxime on the day of admission. the patient'smental status was unchanged as felt by the daughter.past medical history:1. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , on 3 l home o2.2. insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.3. cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by ascites and esophagealvarices as well as possible hepatic encephalopathy.4. hypertension.5. status post cholecystectomy.medications at home:1. fosamax 35 mg p.o. weekly.2. caltrate 600 mg plus d 1 tabler daily.3. cefpodoxime 200 mg daily , which was completed the day priorto admission.4. clotrimazole

, whois her healthcare proxy and can be reached at 976-115-0167. thepatient has never drunk alcohol , smoked , and never used anyillicit drugs. the patient is originally from clear a rieholl andspanish-speaking.family history: unremarkable.physical examination on admission:vital signs: the patient was afebrile. temperature was 96.9 ,heart rate was 62 , and blood pressure was 90/50. she wasbreathing 16 times and was saturating 99% on her home baselinedose of oxygen at 3 l.heent: notable for tongue that showed thrush.neck: jvp was difficult to asses but thought to be slightlyelevated. there was no lymphadenopathy.lungs: dry inspiratory crackles at both bases.cardiovascular: the patient has slow heart rate with normal s1and s2. no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.abdomen: slightly distended , soft , and nontender with noguarding and positive bowel sounds.extremities: remarkable for 3+ edema , pitted , to the knees.neurologic: no asterixis and no focal deficits.laboratory data on admission: electrolytes were remarkable forbun and creatinine of 65/1.6 as well as a potassium of 6.0.albumin was noted to be 2.6. cbc showed a white count of 8.51 ,hematocrit of 34.7 , and platelets of 92 with less than 5% bands.studies: ekg reveals sinus bradycardia at 50 beats per minutewith normal axis and normal intervals and nonspecific stabnormalities , unchanged from prior ekgs. a chest x-ray showedunchanged coarse bilateral opacities with no acute process.impression: the patient is a 76-year-old female with history ofidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosiscomplicated by ascites and esophageal varices , who was admittedwith hyperglycemia and volume overload.hospital course by system:1. endocrine: the patient was admitted with hyperglycemia andsugar in the 600s. the patient was initially started on insulindrip at 4 units per hour , and her sugars quickly normalized. thepatient was transitioned over to subcutaneous insulin regimenthat included lantus and q.a.c. aspartate as well as slidingscale. the patient's fingersticks remained labile throughoutthis admission and at times were elevated in the 300s and othertimes were normal in the range of 70 to 90. the patient'sinsulin was titrated , and she was discharged on a regimen thatincluded lantus 90 units subcutaneously daily as well asaspartate 28 units subcutaneously before each meal. it wasnoticed that the patient had the most difficulty withpostprandial sugars often after lunch and dinner. therefore , werecommended that if she continues to have hyperglycemia , that itwould be best to titrate the q.a.c. aspartate. it would be bestto avoid titrating the lantus too much given that her fastingsugar in the morning was often normal. the patient had nohypoglycemic episodes during this admission. of note , thepatient was not previously on q.a.c. insulin dosing at home;however , following discharge from rehabilitation , it was thoughtthat this would not likely be the best regimen for her. this wasdiscussed with the patient's family and caregivers who wereamenable to this idea , however , will likely need furtherteaching.2. gi: the patient has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosiscomplicated by ascites and esophageal varices. the patient wasthought to be grossly volume overloaded due to her cirrhosis andhypoalbuminemia on admission. the patient was initially diuresedwith iv lasix with good results. the patient did have a bump inher creatinine due to this aggressive diuresis and her lasix washeld for several days , but her oral lasix was restarted prior todischarge. the patient was discharged on 60 mg of p.o. lasixtwice daily. the patient on admission was thought to havesignificant amount of ascites based on abdominal exam. thepatient had recently completed a course of treatment forspontaneous bacterial peritonitis and had no abdominal tendernessbut did have distention. an abdominal ultrasound was obtained asa diagnostic paracentesis was considered given that the patienthad an episode of confusion; however , abdominal ultrasoundrevealed only a small lot of ascites that was not amenable toparacentesis. the patient has a history of esophageal varicesand was continued on her nadolol for prophylaxis. the patientwas continued on her bactrim for sbp prophylaxis. the patientdid have an episode of confusion and delirium during thisadmission , which was felt to be likely due to hepaticencephalopathy. the patient's delirium improved with theinitiation of lactulose. the patient was discharged on lactulose30 ml q.i.d. , which we titrated so that the patient has at least3 bowel movements daily. at the time of discharge , the patientwas alert and oriented. of note , the patient was not started onaldactone for management of her volume overload given that shewas admitted with hyperkalemia and has a history of elevatedpotassium.3. neurologic: the patient had had one episode of deliriumduring this admission where she was confused , did not know whereshe was , and was not interacting with her family appropriately.the patient had a workup at that time , which included aninfectious workup , which revealed no evidence of infection. thepatient was started on lactulose , which had to be an administeredinitially by retention enema as she was refusing to take p.o.the patient's mental status improved within 24 hours of startingthe lactulose , and she was continued on this regimen and will bedischarged on it. of note , the patient had no asterixis ondischarge.4. renal: the patient has a history of chronic kidney diseasewith a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.7. the patient wasadmitted with a creatinine of 1.6 , which did increase slightlywith increased diuresis. the patient's lasix was held for a dayor two and then she was restarted on her oral home lasix regimen ,which was titrated to 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. of note , the patient'slisinopril was held on admission due to hyperkalemia. thelisinopril was not restarted prior to discharge given thepatient's history of hyperkalemia and several episodes duringthis admission , which required the administration of kayexalate.the patient likely should be on an ace inhibitor for chronickidney disease , but this can be re-added as an outpatient withvery close monitoring of her potassium as this was felt to beindicated by the patient's primary care physician. of note , thepatient was normotensive off lisinopril during this admission.5. pulmonary: the patient has history of ipf and had no acutepulmonary issues during this admission. the patient wassaturating well on her home dose of o2 throughout the entireadmission. the patient was continued on her home dose ofdexamethasone for ipf.6. infectious disease: prior to discharge , the patient wasincidentally noted to have a urine culture that was growinggreater than 100 , 000 colonies. the patient was afebrile and hadno symptoms of dysuria but did have a mildly elevated white countof 11 , 000. based on the patient's recent uti , she was started oncefpodoxime for a short 5-day course. results of this urineculture will need to be followed up and her antibiotics adjustedas necessary. the patient was continued on her bactrim for bothspep and pcp prophylaxis.code status: the patient was full code throughout this entire admission.physical exam at the time of discharge: the patient home wasafebrile and normotensive with the heart rate in the 60s to 70sand was saturating in the high 90s on her baseline 3 l of o2 vianasal cannula. her weight at the time of discharge was 198pounds. her cardiac exam was normal. her lungs had finecrackles at both bases. her abdomen was obese with no fluidwave. her extremities had bilateral pitting edema to the kneesand she had no asterixis.discharge

care physicianshould be contacted for any weight gain greater than 5 pounds.the patient should have a chem-7 checked within the next 2 to 3days to follow her creatinine as well as her potassium.2. the patient had a urine culture sent prior to discharge thatrevealed 100 , 000 colonies of bacteria that were not yetidentified at the time of discharge. the patient was thenstarted empirically on cefpodoxime based on past microbiologicdata. the results of this urine culture should be followed up ina day or two and her antibiotics can be adjusted as necessary.follow-up appointment:1. the patient has appointment with her gastroenterologist , dr.darbonne , on 3/6/07 at 2:20 p.m. in the afternoon.2. the patient has follow-up appointment with her primary carephysician , dr. frush , on

red blood cells.there were no white blood cells.hospital course: the patient was admitted to the medical servicewith a presumptive diagnosis of a left sidedstroke. a head ct was performed on hospital day number one but wasnegative with no evidence of cerebral infarct or bleeding.however , a follow up head ct on hospital day number threedemonstrated acute infarct in the left insular capsule and leftcorona radiata. a carotid ultrasound was obtained on hospital daynumber five which demonstrated bilateral carotid plaques with lessthan 50 percent stenosis of both carotid arteries. because of thepatient's history of diabetes and his cardiac history , especiallygiven his prior myocardial infarction , the patient was placed on aromi protocol. the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarctionand he was given a cardiac echocardiogram on hospital day numbertwo. the echocardiogram demonstrated increased left ventricularsize with preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of65 percent. he had dilated left and right atria and he hadthickened mitral valve leaflets with 4+ mitral regurgitation , withflow reversible into his pulmonary veins. he also had 3 to 4+tricuspid

pressures of 55 to 60 mm of mercury. he was notedto have a trivial pericardial effusion. of note , there was noevidence of any thrombus in the heart. however , because of thenature of his stroke , which was felt to be embolic by neurology , aswell as his enlarged atria. the patient was placed on iv heparinand he was then started on oral coumadin for long-termanticoagulation. the patient did very well after his stroke andhis original slurred speech improved markedly over the course ofhis admission. he also regained full strength in his right arm ,although he continued to have some decreased coordination in thatarm. the patient also demonstrated inability to swallow withoutdifficulty and an esophagogram with video analysis was performed onhospital day number six , prior to his discharge. the video studyof his swallowing demonstrated that he had essentially normalswallowing and he was cleared to go home on a regular diet. ofnote , his blood pressure tended to be low , around 100 to 110systolic , while in the hospital , so his lisinopril was discontinuedand he was given instructions that lisinopril would be restarted byhis cmc attending after his discharge. his hydroxyurea wasincreased from 500 mg to 1 gram q day. the patient did quite wellafter his stroke and he was discharged home with services onapril , 1995.medications on discharge: his discharge medications

cellulitis , left thigh abscess , statuspost i&d.2 ) acute renal failure.history of present illness: mrs. bradham is a pleasant 52 year oldobese black female with history ofdiabetes , chronic lower extremity venous stasis , history ofcellulitis who presented with left lower extremity pain , edema , anderythema. the patient has had a long history of diabetes since1984 for which she has been treated with diet and glyburide withpoorly controlled blood sugars until metformin was added inoctober of 1996. in the past five years the patient has alsobecome morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds.since 1995 she has noted development of significant bilateral lowerextremity swelling. in october of 1996 she was treated for diabeticstasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home ivantibiotics. part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling wasattributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which wasthought to be compromising venous return. her massive edema wastreated unsuccessfully with lasix.the patient was doing well until about a week prior to admissionwhen she developed some diarrhea consisting of two to three bowelmovements a day. her stool was watery brown without any blood ormucus. she also reported some nausea and vomiting as well aschills. she believes that she had fevers , but these temperatureswere not measured. one day after the onset of her diarrhea thepatient noted the development of burning pain on her left anteriorthigh just above her knee. this was associated with increasederythema and mildly increased swelling in that area. she reportsthat her diarrhea , there had been stool running down her left thighthe previous day. this area of erythema on her left legsubsequently spread to the lateral surface of the thigh and wasassociated with increasing pain. the pain was so severe that itprevented the patient from her daily activities and from walking.the patient presented to the emergency department on 4/8 forworsening of her lower extremity pain and decreased p.o. intake.on the day of admission the patient states that her diarrhea hadresolved and that she has had no abdominal pain. she has had nochest pain or shortness of breath or any other localizing signs ofinfection except her left leg. on admission she was found to havea temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit and she was placed in theshort stay unit. subsequently her admission labs were noted toreveal elevated lfts and an elevated bun and creatinine with awhite blood cell count of 35 , 000. because of these abnormalitiesand renal failure , the patient was transferred out of the shortstay unit to the general medicine team for further care.past medical history: noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.bilateral lower extremity edema with chronicvenous stasis changes. history of cellulitis. history ofhypertension. uterine fibroid. hypercholesterolemia.osteoarthritis. hemoglobin c trace.allergies: no known drug allergies.medications on admission: glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. lisinopril 20 mgb.i.d. lasix 80 mg q a.m. metformin500 mg b.i.d. naprosyn 375 mg b.i.d. p.r.n.medications on transfer from short stay unit: ancef 1 gram iv q 8.colace 100 mg b.i.d.insulin sliding scale. lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.family history: notable for a sister with diabetes mellitus.social history: the patient denies alcohol , cigarettes , or druguse. the patient lives in sa na oak and caresfor four young grandchildren.physical examination: the patient was an obese , pleasant , africanamerican woman in no apparent distress. hertemperature was 99.4 , blood pressure 110/74 , pulse rate of 92 ,respiratory rate 20 , o2 sat 96% on room air. her heent exam wasnonicteric with moist oropharynx and no lesions. the neck wassupple without any lymphadenopathy. she had a right ej iv line.there were no carotid bruits. her lungs were clear to auscultationwith no cva tenderness. her heart was regular rate and rhythm.there was a faint s4 and a loud p2 component to the s2 sound. herabdominal exam was obese , non-positive for bowel sounds. there wasmild tenderness over the periumbilical region with some fullness/suggestion of a mass. there was no rebound or guarding , no rightupper quadrant tenderness , no hepatomegaly/splenomegaly ( examlimited by obesity ). her extremity exam revealed marked bilateralswelling in both lower extremities with chronic stasis changes.there were multiple venous plaques on the pretibial areas of bothlegs with one venous plaque being ulcerated on the right pretibarea. examination of her left thigh revealed a patch of erythemaand warmth that was very tender to the touch. neurologic exam wasalert and oriented times three , intact cranial nerves iii-xii.there was slight decrease in sensation in the patient's lowerextremity , left greater than right to pin sensation. her motorexam was otherwise unremarkable. her rectal exam was reported tobe guaiac negative per the emergency department.laboratories on admission: sodium 133 , potassium 5.2 , bun 43 , andcreatinine of 3.7. the patient's lastcreatinine value on record was in september of 1996 which was 0.6. herlfts revealed an alt of 71 , ast of 57 , ldh 717 , alkalinephosphatase 196 , total bilirubin 1.1 , direct bilirubin 0.6. heramylase was 8. her albumin was 2.1 and her calcium was 8.2. hercbc on admission revealed a white cell count of 34 , 000 , hematocritof 29 , and platelets of 624 , 000. the differential on the whiteblood cell count was 78 polys , 38 bands , 6 lymphs , 3 monocytes , andno eos. her mcv on her hematocrit was 77. her pt and ptt wereboth within normal limits. her urinalysis revealed 3+ protein , 1+leukocyte esterase , 8-12 white blood cells , 20-25 red blood cells ,and 2+ squamous epithelial cells.chest x-ray on admission revealed low lung volumes with possibleleft total effusion that was blurring left lower lobe air spacedisease. abdominal ultrasound performed on admission revealed nohydronephrosis , a normal liver biliary system. study was limitedsecondary to body habitus. lower extremity non-invasive studiesrevealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. however , exam waslimited secondary to habitus.hospital course: by issues:1. left thigh cellulitis: the patient was started on ancefrenally dosed for her left thigh cellulitis. her legs were keptraised and her white blood cell and fever curves followed. aninfectious disease consult as well as a dermatology consult wasobtained to assist with antibiotics as well as dressing for herlower extremity changes. blood cultures and wound cultures sentdid not reveal any organisms. because of the patient's very highwhite blood cell count , the id consult team was concerned for thepossibility of toxic shock syndrome; therefore , clindamycin iv wasalso added to her regimen of antibiotics. also per idrecommendation , stool cultures were sent for e. coli 0167: h7 whichwas negative. although there was an initial fall in the patient'swhite count during the first several days of antibiotics , thiswhite count subsequently began rising again. this was associatedwith continued poor resolution of the pain in the patient's leftthigh and perhaps worsening erythema. because the patient's leftleg did not appear to be getting better on antibiotics , a surgicalconsult was obtained to rule out a deeper seated infection in thepatient's thigh. imaging of the patient's leg with mri wasattempted but was unsuccessful secondary to the patient's largesize. a ct of both of her legs were obtained instead whichrevealed no evidence of an abscess in her left leg , however , it didincidentally detect a large effusion in the patient's left knee.one week after admission the patient noted acute worsening of thepain in her left knee. because of the known left knee effusion , aconcern for a septic knee joint was raised. a rheumatology consultwas obtained. the left knee was tapped using ultrasound guidanceremoving 20 cc of turbid knee fluid. studies on the left kneeeffusion revealed 13 , 000 white blood cells with negative gram stainand negative crystal exam times 3. cultures of the left knee fluiddid not grow any organisms. despite these findings , we were stillconcerned that this was a partially treated septic joint given thepatient had been on antibiotics for one week. for this reason anorthopedic consult was obtained and the patient was taken to the orfor possible debridement. on 6/19 the patient was taken to theoperating room where an abscess on the left lateral distal thighwas found and drained. a total of approximately 20 cc of pus wasremoved by dr. sudler . there was no connection between the puscollection and the left knee effusion. after the drainage , thepatient's clinical status improved dramatically with a decrease inher white count and increased mobility of her leg. she wascontinued on ancef iv and p.o. ofloxacillin which had been addedfor gram negative coverage. the clindamycin was subsequentlydiscontinued. on the day prior to discharge the patient's whiteblood cell count had fallen to 10 , 000. she remained afebrile.2. renal: on admission the patient was noted to have a creatinineof 3.7 with a baseline known to be 0.6 in september of 1996. however , onsearching through the patient's records it appears that the patienthad been noted to have increased proteinuria since september of 1996.the acute renal failure was initially thought to be secondary todehydration; the patient was given iv hydration with no improvementin her creatinine. for that reason , a renal consult was obtainedon the third day of admission. it was the impression of the renalservice that the patient's acute renal failure was likelymultifactorial secondary to a combination of diabetic nephropathy ,low albumin , volume loss secondary to diarrhea , infection , andmedications which included nsaids as well as ace inhibitor. forthat reason , the patient's nephrotoxic medications , which includelisinopril and metformin , were discontinued. the patient'selectrolytes and volume status was followed closely for the rest ofthe course of the hospitalization with continued gradualimprovement. her creatinine peaked at 4.7. on discharge thepatient's creatinine had resolved back to 2.2.3. right upper extremity swelling: on the day after the patientreturned from the operating room for the drainage of her leftthigh , she was found to have new onset of swelling in her right armand breast. initially we were concerned for the presence of aright upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. upper extremitynon-invasive studies were obtained which were negative for anyclots. an echocardiogram was also obtained showing no evidence ofright heart dysfunction. a nuclear flow study was also attemptedbut was unsuccessful because of the failure to obtain venous accesson the patient's right arm. the leahgulf mary katon hospital team was alsoconsulted regarding the use of heparin. however , given that thepatient had poor access and had an anemia , it was decided that thepatient would not be heparinized. her right upper extremityswelling was observed closely and with elevation of the right armover the next few days gradually resolved without anycomplications. on the day prior to discharge a repeat right upperextremity ultrasound was obtained which revealed no evidence ofblood clots in her right arm.4. hematology: on admission the patient was found to have a lowhematocrit with a low mvc. iron studies were performed whichrevealed the likely presence of iron deficiency. for that reasonthe patient was placed on iron sulfate 30 mg t.i.d. the patientwas guaiac negative , thus ruling out evidence of a chronic gibleed. the patient's anemia is also likely a reflection of herrenal dysfunction.5. gi: although the patient had experienced some diarrhea priorto admission , her diarrhea resolved in the hospital. all of herstool studies were negative. abdominal ultrasound revealed noabnormalities in the patient's liver or biliary system to accountfor the mild transaminitis found on admission. it is likely thatthe patient had a bout of viral gastroenteritis a few days prior toadmission which resolved spontaneously.disposition: to hi health .discharge medications: ancef 1 gram iv q.8h. times 14 days.ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days.lotrimin topical applied b.i.d. to toes and webs of toes. nystatinpowder topical b.i.d. applied to groin area. polysporin ointmenttopical applied to right pretibial ulcer with dressing. ironsulfate 300 mg p.o.

,dressing changes on her left leg p.r.n.saturation ( probably at least q shift ) with 4 x 8 kerlix/abdpads/kerlix wrap with fine dry bulky soft dressing.the patient is discharged with iv ancef for an additional 14 daysas well as p.o. ofloxacin for 14 days. the patient will requirefollow-up with a doctor while at hightalon geer of health to determine changes inthe antibiotics regimen. as for the patient's right pretibialulcer , that will require daily wet to dry dressing with theapplication of polysporin.condition on discharge: stable.follow-up: the patient is to be followed up by her primary

rightventricle malfunction , and anticoagulation was started; however ,there was no evidence of clot on echo. in addition , on echo ,reevaluated for dyssynchrony , which was negative. the patientwas diuresed with iv lasix until near euvolemic and thentransitioned to p.o. regimen. the patient was maintained onaldactone. the ep service evaluated for possible placement ofaicd versus biventricular pacemaker; however , given the patientis not yet outside of three-month window and was noninducible onep study , she will need close monitoring as an outpatient withrepeat echo in 2 months and a further ep study to readdress. thepatient will be anticoagulated in the meantime. respiratory:the patient has history of copd with no evidence of acuteexacerbation. inhalers were continued. pfts and vo2 study maybe considered as an outpatient. renal: creatinine was mildlyelevated compared with baseline , likely secondary to mild dyenephropathy and overaggressive diuresis. creatinine stabilized

initially evaluated on march , 1996 forright knee pain. evaluation revealed a small right knee effusionconsistent with mechanical derangement secondary to obesity. thetap was negative for crystals and had negative cultures. thepatient was initially supposed to go home , however due toinadequate support , she was kept overnight on the evening of september , 1996. overnight she received vistaril , percocet as well assome demerol and oxycodone. on the morning of march , 1996 , shewas found to be unresponsive with bloody saliva dripping from hermouth. a code green was called. they were unable to find a bloodpressure. the patient was intubated. dopamine was started.narcan was given. the blood pressure recovered. the patientawakened and the patient's initial arterial blood gas prior tointubation was 7.04 ph , pco2 137 and po2 of 85 and she wassubsequently admitted to the medical intensive care unit.past medical history: her past medical history is significant fora restrictive lung disease. past pulmonaryfunction tests revealed an fev of 1.8 which is in the 56thpercentile and fev1 of 1.6 which is in the 59th percentile , tlc of3.3 in the 54th percentile and dlco at 116th percentile. she hasbeen on long term home oxygen with oxygen saturation between 85%and 90% on two liters of nasal cannula. arterial blood gases onprior admissions have revealed po2 in 50 , pco2 in the high 40s tolow 50s. she has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. she hasbeen evaluated in the past with even trace apnea screen in augustof 1994 which revealed approximately 19 apnea events in just over10 hours. the oxygen saturation decreased to 61% at the minimumand subsequently she had respiratory monitoring in september of 1995 withc-pap which revealed a decrease in the apnea episodes to 19 eventsin about 480 minutes with oxygen saturation decreasing to a minimumof 71%. apparently , by report , attempts had been made to start thepatient on the c-pap at home , but the patient had been resistantand she has a long history of medical non-compliance. she has ahistory of recurrent deep venous thromboses in which she has hadmultiple medical admissions , most recently about six in the pastyear , most recently in october of 1996 , for cellulitis of the leftlower extremity , in july of 1996 , bilateral calf tenderness withnegative non-invasive studies and in september of 1996 , most recentlywith right lower extremity cellulitis and this was complicated byapparent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare. the patienthas had multiple vq scans in the past , all of which have been lowprobability. the patient has been on chronic coumadin , howeverthere is a question of whether or not , she has been taking itregularly. there has also been a question in the past of possiblediastolic dysfunction. in september of 1994 , she had anechocardiogram which showed some left ventricular hypertrophy , noregional wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction ofapproximately 55% , no right ventricular hypertrophy or tricuspidregurgitation. other past medical history includes a history ofdepression. the patient has been managed with zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.day. she is status post midline hernia repair. she is status postbilateral tubal ligation. the patient has chronic hypoxemia ,obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , chronic lower extremity deepvenous thromboses and obstructive lung disease.medications on admission: 1 ) diltiazem 120 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )albuterol 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. 4 ) k-dur 20 meq p.o. q. day. 5 )axid 150 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6 ) zoloft 50 mg p.o. q. day. 7 ) lasix20 mg p.o. q. day. 8 ) coumadin alternating 10 mg with 7.5 mg p.o.q. day.social history: significant for the patient living alone. sheoccasional has her son stay with her. she isdivorced and she has refused chronic care in the past.habits: positive for cigarettes about a 20 pack year history. noalcohol , no intravenous drugs.hospital course: 1 ) pulmonary: the patient was admitted to themedical intensive care unit on march , 1996status post a respiratory arrest thought to be secondary tohypercarbia through the combination of the patient's underlyinglung disease as well as excessive sedation. she was intubated onmarch , 1996 and quickly extubated on april , 1996 withoutcomplications. her chest x-ray on admission was significant for amild interstitial pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. afterextubation , the patient was weaned to bi-pap with which she wasable to maintain saturations between 86-90% while in the medicalintensive care unit. the patient was transferred to the floor onfebruary , 1996. given the patient's history of restrictive lungdisease , it was thought that it was time to have a full work-up tosearch for a possible etiologies , questioning possible obesity vs.parenchymal disease. she had an echocardiogram on august , 1996 ,which revealed an ejection fraction of 75% , mild left ventricularhypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormalities , a top normalsized right ventricle , trace tricuspid insufficiency and asuggested pulmonary arterial pressure in the range of 36 mm ofmercury plus the estimated right atrial pressure. thisechocardiogram was performed with a bubble study and there was noobvious intra-cardiac shunt either by color doppler or salineinfusion. they were unable to exclude diastolic dysfunction giventhe presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. her chest ct onaugust , 1996 was significant for cardiomegaly and pulmonaryedema , patchy opacities in the right apex and lung bases with anodular quality of unclear etiology and a lucent lesion in theright lobe of the liver that was too small to characterize. inorder to further help sort out the etiology of her restrictive lungdisease , the patient underwent a pa gram on september , 1996 to ruleout the possibility of chronic pulmonary emboli. this studyrevealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli. she had a normalpulmonary vascular distribution , elevated right heart pressureswith pulmonary arterial pressure of 44/13 with a mean of 28 mm ofmercury , right ventricular pressure 52/2 with a mean of 20 mm ofmercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23. thepulmonary service had been consulted and it was thought that it wasdifficult to sort out exactly what was going on. it was unclearwhat the nodular lesions described on the ct represented , whetherit was inflammation or some sort of firm nodule. it was decided tofollow-up on the ct in the future and to have the patient had arepeat sleep study as well as repeat pulmonary function tests. theoverall impression was that her restrictive lung disease was mostlikely secondary to obesity. while the patient was on the floor ,we attempted to restart her on the bi-pap , however the patientresisted using both the c-pap and the bi-pap practically everynight complaining that she had an upper respiratory infection thatmade it difficult for her to wear the machine. on the evening thatshe did actually try both the c-pap and the bi-pap , she was notedto have labored breathing with the c-pap at 5 mm of mercury andfour liters nasal cannula with a pulse oximetry dropping to 81%.when she switched to bi-pap with settings of 12 mm of mercuryinspiratory and 7 mm of mercury expiratory , she was able tomaintain oxygen saturations between 88% and as high as 93% oxygensaturation. her oxygen saturations throughout hospitalizationranged between 91-93% on two liters nasal cannula during the dayand as well as 88% overnight. it was decided that the patientgiven her history would require bi-pap on discharge as well as herhome oxygen.2 ) infectious disease: the patient as noted above spiked atemperature to 101 degrees on march , 1996 while in the medicalintensive care unit and subsequently never had elevatedtemperatures nor an elevated white blood cell count. she wasstarted on clindamycin and ofloxacin intravenously and thenswitched to p.o. on february , 1996 to complete a ten day course.on march , 1996 , the patient as stated , remained afebrilethroughout her hospitalization and never had an elevated whiteblood cell count. she did complain of upper respiratory symptomsbeginning on february , 1996 described as general head fullness ,sinus tenderness and nasal congestion. she was started on afrin 2puffs b.i.d. for three days with some relief as well as robitussinand sudafed. her physical examination was notable some maxillarysinusitis and the patient was actually discharged after a brieftime on afrin nasal spray.3 ) cardiovascular: echocardiogram was performed during thisadmission and is as described above. the patient remainedhemodynamically stable throughout this admission.4 ) hematology: the patient had a history of recurrent lowerextremity deep venous thromboses. she was maintained on heparinuntil all of her procedures had been completed and was restarted oncoumadin on september , 1996. her pt and ptt were followed untilthe point that she had established a therapeutic inr. on august , 1996 , her pt and ptt were notable for a pt of 17.5 with a pttof greater than 200 and inr of 2.2. heparin was discontinued and arepeat ptt on the evening of july , 1996 revealed a pt of 18.5and a ptt of 67.6 and an inr of 2.5. she was discharged the nextday on 7.5 mg of coumadin q.h.s. of note , the patient had beenadmitted with about a 2 x 2 cm ulcer of her medial left malleoluswhich appeared to heal well with granulation and scarred by thetime she had been discharged.5 ) rheumatology: the patient as noted was admitted for evaluationof right knee pain. the patient did not complain of right painsubsequent to her discharge from the medical intensive care unit.her cultures and crystals were negative and she is to follow-up asan outpatient with the rheumatologist in their clinic.6 ) endocrine: the patient maintained stable bowel sounds onglyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day.7 ) gastrointestinal: the patient remained stable and was able totolerate a low cholesterol , low saturated fat diet and wasmaintained on axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. however , on the date ofdischarge , the patient was complaining of a burning sensation inher throat after drinking orange juice which tended to come and go ,but did not radiate and she was switched from axid to prilosec 20mg p.o. q. day on march , 1996.8 ) gynecology: while on the floor , the patient startedcomplaining of some vaginal spotting. she has menopausal since her40s and has had not had any recent gynecological following. it wasdecided for the patient to either follow-up with her primary carephysician or with the gyn clinic at n'ssciences memorial hospital for evaluation of this spotting for ruling out endometrialcarcinoma.9 ) neurological: the patient did not demonstrate any evidence ofdepression and was stable on zoloft.10 ) general care: the patient underwent physical therapy andoccupational therapy throughout the hospitalization. it wasthought that she would benefit greatly from inpatient pulmonaryrehabilitation or possibly weight loss reduction , however thepatient repeatedly declined pulmonary rehabilitation and weightloss reduction and felt that she would be able to manage herself athome.the patient was discharged on march , 1996 in stable conditionto home with vna services to follow-up on her blood sugars , herhome oxygen as well as her bi-pap.medications on discharge: 1 ) lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )procardia xl 30 mg p.o. q. day. 4 )

pulmonary follow-up is as follows:on february , 1996 at 9:00 am , she is to have a repeat ct tofollow-up the nodularities found on the most recent ct. onfebruary , 1996 at 10:30 am , she is to have a pulmonary functiontest and to follow-up at 11:30 am with the pulmonary clinic. sheis to call rheumatology at her convenience.the patient was to proceed with bi-pap , however due to theneed for medical assistance , she may not receive it for another twoweeks and is to continue with her home oxygen.dictated by: clarence j. tenbusch , m.d. ch94attending: antione wilson granville cihon , m.d. mb1

sadlier mdhistory of present illness: the patient was admitted on 9/14/04for a right plantar surface neurotrophic ulcer secondary todiabetes mellitus. the patient has a long-standing history ofperipheral neuropathy and slight history of peripheral vasculardisease. this has been treated thus far by podiatricdebridements until the day of admission when the patientpresented low-grade fevers and chills. the patient also has ahistory of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , distant past ofpancreatitis , gout , neuropathy , high cholesterol , and chronicrenal insufficiency. he has had a left fourth and fifth toeamputation before. he has also undergone recent eye surgery ofunknown origin and had some unknown pancreatic surgery in 1968most likely for phlegmon or some sort of pancreatic condition.the patient was admitted on 9/14/04 with a right plantar surfaceneurotrophic ulcer as well as recent history of low-grade feversand chills.the patient notes that the ulcer came about after some unknowntrauma to the foot. he had been followed by podiatrist and hadoutpatient mri revealing osteo at the fifth metatarsal head andthe fourth metatarsal shaft , presented to the egan healthcareemergency department after having a fever of 101.3 degrees. onadmission , the patient had a low-grade fever of 99.7 degrees ,pulse in the 90s , respiratory rate 16 , and blood pressure 144/67.he was saturating 95% on room air.medications:at the time of admission were as follows:1. lantus 100 mg q.p.m.2. humalog 20 units q.p.m.3. humalog sliding scale.4. neurontin 300 mg t.i.d.5. lisinopril 40 mg q.d.6. allopurinol 300 mg q.d.7. hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.8. zocor 20 mg q.d.9. tricor 50 mg b.i.d.10. atenolol 25 mg q.d.11. eyedrops prednisolone and atropine.12. the patient was on iron supplementation.physical examination: notable findings and/or that the patienthad clear breath sounds and regular rate and rhythm. on cardiacexamination had a slight murmur 2/6 along the left sternal borderand otherwise had a obese abdomen. the extremities and backrevealed no abnormalities except for a right foot ulcer along thefourth and fifth metatarsal distal heads. the patient also had asomewhat cyanotic appearing and somewhat edematous and swollenfifth right toe. the patient had decreased sensation bilaterallyin the feet up to mid shin. the patient also had a known historyof drug allergies.laboratory data:at the time of admission , the patient's significant labs were asfollows , his potassium was 4.3 , bun was 38 , creatinine was 3.2 ,and his blood glucose was 187. his white blood cell count was12.6 and hematocrit was 27.8.hospital course:the patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service underdr. tosco and was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , andflagyl. he continued to have low-grade fevers over the course ofthe next three days. finally , on hospital day 3 , had a fever of103.2. it was decided that at the time of admission , the patientwould need to undergo an amputation of the third and fourth toeas well as metatarsal heads to remove the infected bone andsource of osteomyelitis. on hospital day 3 , the patient wastaken to the operating room. it should be noted at that timethat the patient's creatinine bumped before his operation from abun of 39 and a creatinine of 2.1 to a bun of 59 on hospital day3 and a creatinine of 3.9. this occurred coincidentally the dayafter the patient had several mris of is lower extremities tobetter understand the vascular supply to his lower extremities.therefore , the patient had contrast dye. although , this dye wasgadolinium , which is sued commonly for mra and is not usuallyassociated with any soft of renal toxicities.the patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day 3 fora right fourth and fifth toe amputation and nonhealing ulcerdebridement. please refer to the operative note by dr.guemmer for further details. the patient tolerated theprocedure without any problems and the patient control wasadequate by postoperative day 1. however on postoperative labcheckup , it was see that the patient's creatinine bumped to 4.9with a bun of 61. this was viewed and was monitored by serialbun and creatinine checks. the following , bun and creatininecame back at 69 for bun and 5.2 for creatinine. on postoperativeday #1 , the patient's creatinine continued to rise and was foundto be 6.5 with a bun of 81. at this point , the renal service wasconsulted for further input as far as possible causes of acuterenal failure in the phase of chronic renal insufficiency andpostoperative period. the patient's vancomycin level came to bein the therapeutic range of 30.8. fena was checked whichrevealed 0.74% fena. this was rechecked and revealed a fena of0.97% both , which indicated prerenal failure. renal team alsoadvised checking for other causes of the patient's anemia as wellas other causes of the renal failure. labs have been sent andsome are currently pending regarding the c3-c4 and anti-gmbantibodies.the patient's creatinine continued to rise despite advancedmanagement including with iv resuscitation , fluid volume boluses ,and occasional boluses of lasix. eventually , the patient's bunand creatinine rose to 94 and 8.3 by postoperative day 2. by thefollowing day , however postoperative day 3 , the patient'screatinine and bun began resolving that bun of 95 and acreatinine 7.8. however , at the same time , the patient beganhaving hypoglycemic episodes in response to the lantus dose thathe was getting at home and continue to get here in hospital. itwas summarized by the renal team as well as by the surgicalservice and that the patient may have not been taking hismedication at home and now was being his medications , while herein the hospital. by postoperative day 4 , the patient continuedto have dysregulation of his fingerstick blood glucoses rangingfrom a high of 367 to a low of 52 where she began to besymptomatic , somewhat somnolent , and groggy.this patient's blood glucose control was evaluated by thediabetes management service and it was summarized by them thatthe patient's renal insufficiency had a significant role in thepatient's hypoglycemic episodes and that he ended up havinginsulin toxicity due to poor creatinine clearance and renalfunctioning level. it should be noted that in light of thispatient's postoperative complications of acute renal failure inthe phase of chronic renal failure and chronic renalinsufficiency , the patient never required a hemodialysis becausethe potassium levels remained stable. the high that the patientreached was 5.6 of potassium on the same day that he had acreatine of 8.3 , which was on postoperative day #2 , this wastreated with kayexalate and along the same lines , the patient'smedications were evaluated and it was decided to decrease it tob.i.d. dosing and to start holding lisinopril , neurontin , andvancomycin for their possible renal toxic effects. a renalultrasound was obtained on postoperative day #1 as well asdoppler flow studies. the renal ultrasound revealed normalparenchyma with somewhat decreased renal indices indicating somedecreased amount of blood flow to their kidneys. at the sametime , an mra of the renal arteries was obtained which revealed nostenosis lesions of the kidneys.the patient was eventually started on phoslo and ferrlecit aswell as epogen 10 , 000 units q. week at the recommendation of therenal service. this was continued during the duration of thepatient's stay and should continue in the postoperativehospitalization. in light of this postoperative complications ,the creatinine became stable by postoperative day 3 and bloodpressure medications were restarted at previous doses and weretitrated to the need that the patient demonstrated by his bloodpressure control. this was eventually attained on atenolol at150 mg q.d. however , renal service recommended that the patientbe given lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. this seems to have controlledthe patient's blood pressure for the time being. physicaltherapy was also involved in evaluating the patient and assistedin the management of this patient's care.it should also be noted that a wax sponge was placed on thepatient's right open wound. this was placed on postoperative day#3 , 4/18/04 .  the patient seems to be tolerating this well. thediabetes management service , the physical therapy , and the renalteams continued to follow the patient closely during the durationof his stay until it was felt that the patient's postoperativecomplications and issues including blood glucose control as wellas renal insufficiency were under control. from an operativestandpoint , the patient tolerated the procedure well and it wasdecided to continue the patient on levofloxacin for a one weekcourse and the patient is to be discharged to the rehab facility ,which is the still freedral hospital for their ability tocare for wax sponge excellently.the patient was seen by dr. ulvan in the renal staff and by thediabetes management service by dr. clint holets , pager #596-76. thephysical examination at the time of discharge was unchanged fromthe previous few days where the patient was seen to have adequatedoppler signal in all his pedal pulses , dps as well as pts and afaintly palpable right dp and as well as faintly palpable leftdp.discharge medications:the patient is to be discharged on the following medications ,tylenol 650 to 1000 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. for temperature greaterthan 101 , allopurinol 100 mg p.o.

showed no reversible ischemia. chest x-ray asdescribes above. ua negative for uti.impression:the patient was evaluated to be low likelihood for havingpneumonia. she was thought to more likely have volume overloadsecondary to chf. because of her visual problems and decliningphysical condition and deconditioning , patient's current livingsituation and arrangements are possibly insufficient for herincreasing needs and error in self administration of medicationsor increasing renal insufficiency or poor p.o. intake may haveprecipitated her hypoglycemic episode and altered mental status.hospital course:id/pulmonary: right lower lobe pneumonia versus chf , pleuraleffusion. this was treated initially with levofloxacin althoughit is unlikely consolidated lobar pneumonia because of thepatient's good clinical status , lack of fever and white count andlack of toxicity. sputum culture and gram stein wereunremarkable. pleural effusion on the right decreased onlyminimally with diuresis of 1 to 2 liters overnight and fordiagnostic and therapeutic purposes , the patient underwent athoracentesis on 3/1/05 and had withdraw 800 cc of clear yellowfluid whose chemistries and cell count were consistent with asterile transudative effusion. gram stein was negative.cultures are pending at this time and a chest x-ray may berepeated to rule out underlying pneumonia revealed by draining ofthe effusion. urine legionella was negative.renal: chronic renal insufficiency. creatinine is at a baselineof 2.6 and it decreased significantly on this admission possiblybecause of improved forward flow from discontinuation of her aceinhibitor.endocrinology: the patient was admitted with hypoglycemicdiabetes possibly secondary to infection or logistical and socialbarriers. her nph dose was cut to 20 units subcu. q.d. withlispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s. which she needed onlyminimally about 5 units a day and her sugars were well controlledon this regimen which supports the hypothesis that her nph doseof 34 units a day was too high beyond a certain point.cardiac:a. pump: the patient with chf , known valvular dysfunction ,exhibiting pulmonary edema , lower extremity edema and orthopnea.she was initially diuresed with iv lasix and it was noted thather weight was up 10 pounds from her prior admission. she wastransitioned to p.o. lasix after diuresing very well on thisregimen. she continued her lipitor and aspirin , atenolol waschanged metoprolol given her renal insufficiency. lisinopril wasswitched to captopril , then discontinued given her bumpingcreatinine while diuresing on the ace inhibitor. she wasslightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 90s to100s at one point and responded to a bolus of fluid , decrease inthe captopril and holding the lasix , unclear etiology , looksotherwise low. lasix was decreased to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and thepatient should have daily weights and electrolytes checked andrepleted to ensure that her diuresis is only moderate everyday nomore than one liter a day but is consistent such that she is ableto maintain her electrolytes and loose fluid overtime.heme: the patient has a monoclonal gammopathy and a microcytosiswhich might suggest thalassemia. she is on iron and epogen withan improved hematocrit from the prior admission but no change inher mcv , which suggests that she has more than renal diseasecausing her microcytosis. further workup of her monoclonalgammopathy will be deferred to her primary care physician.diabetic diet: low sodium , low fat , low cholesterol.prophylaxis: heparin

where she went nine minutes with non-diagnosticchanges. in april of l988 , she had an exercise tolerance testwith thallium. she went 7 minutes and 33 seconds stopping becauseof shortness of breath with non-diagnostic changes and demonstratedreperfusion defects. she was treated at that time with diltiazemand enalapril. patient did well until february of l990 when shewas admitted to the uscven

nitroglycerin.this continued to progress , always symptoms occurring with exertionwith several episodes of pain on the day of admission notassociated with shortness of breath , diaphoresis , nausea ,

had leadreversal. patient did well after admission with no evident chestpain. there was some concern on admission with the story ofdifficulty sleeping at night raising the possibility of somecongestive heart failure. however , throughout the admission , thepatient showed no symptoms of this. indeed , she slept wellthroughout the nights without any difficulty breathing and therewas no evidence of congestive heart failure on her chest x-ray. thepatient went for cardiac catheterization which demonstrated thatshe had , in fact , reoccluded her dl vessel to 95% stenosis and ofnote , she also had her ombl with a 50% lesion. however , it wasnoted on catheterization that there was a small dissection proximalon the dl vessel providing a relative contraindication to reattemptat ptca. therefore , this procedure was not attempted. it was feltthat the best approach for this patient would be to improve hermedical management at the present time and then at some future dateif necessary , to bring the patient back to catheterization with thehope that an attempt at ptca could be made later. the patient'slopressor was increased to 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. and her isordil wasincreased to 30 mg

hysterectomyadmitted for epistaxis and c/p.1-epistaxis: may be secondary to anti-coagulation vs underlying blooddyscrasia vs allergic rhinitis vs recurrence of previous epistaxis( possible avm ) vs longstanding htn vs tumor. pt had another episodeof nosebleed/clot while an inpatient , but no uncontrollable bleeding.there was no need to tamponade pt's nares , however , in light of her hxof menorrhagia , previous dvt/pe , and family hx of dvt's , it will beimportant to assess for different causes of hyper/hypocoagulability inthis pt as an outpt ( platelet d/o , von willebrand's disorder , hemophilia ,osler-weber-rendu d/o ). it will be also important to assess for possiblenasal avm or ?tumor( low likelihood ). coumadin was continued as pt hashigh risk of forming dvt's. her bp was also controlled withhctz/triamterene and captopril to help control bleeding. pt's bp droppedsignificantly in response to lopressor and hr's were down in the 40's ,thus her lopressor was held. patient needed captopril for high bp , thuswill d/c on lisinopril 2.5. she needs to be followed up for compliance andunderstanding of importance of bp control , as patient was not compliant onmedications on presentation , had very high bp on presentation.2-chest pain: acs vs pe vs gerd vs panic attacks. as pt has severalcardiac risk factors , her ce's were cycled and she was ruled out for mi.an echo was obtained to assess for systolic dysfunction , but ef was 65% ,no effusions were found , and there was only mild mr. pt does not have anofficial dm dx , however , given her obesity , she is at high risk forglucose intolerance , thus a hba1c will need to be obtained as anoutpatient. pt also has a hx of hypercholesterolemia , and a fasting lipidprofile was obtained. it will be important that she take her statinsregularly. the pt had palpable cords and calf tenderness ( l>r ) , so leni'swere obtained prior to d/c and these were negative for dvt , although itwas a poor study due to her size. pt also has a hx of gerd , thus the c/pmay have been 2/2 esophageal spasm or gerd as it radiated to the back andright shoulder. pt denies having had spicy foods or nausea/vomiting beforethe episodes , however. pt had chest tenderness along the sternum and lribcage , which may have contributed to her feeling of c/p. finally , ptseems to have a hx of anxiety , per herself and her daughters and as shefelt she was going to die and felt stressed during the nosebleeding , thiscould have caused her c/p. patient had a adenosine mibi prior to dischargeand this was negative for any ischemic changes , and she was discharged tohome to follow-up with her pcp for further medical management of cardiacrisk factors.3-fibromyalgia: pt was asymptomatic , but we continued her home regimenand pain control.4-fen: ivf were avoided given high bp on admission and k and mag wererepleted as needed. she should continue a low choles/fat , and no saltadded diet.full codeadditional comments: your blood pressure was very high on admission but was easily controlledwith blood pressure medication. this was probably due to not using yourblood pressure medications regularly. it is crucial that you take yourblood pressure medications regularly as prescribed as uncontrolled highblood pressure can lead to heart disease , kidney disease , and eyedisease. you must also watch your diet and eat low cholesterol , lowfat foods and no added sodium , as this can worsen your blood pressureor even lead to heart failure. you must also continue your coumadinregularly as prescribed as you have a high risk of forming blood clots.please come to the ed if you have continued uncontrolled nose bleeds ,severe uncontrollable headaches , fainting spells , chest pain , orshortness of breath.discharge condition: stableto do/plan:1. follow-up hgba1c , bp control , lipid panel , and chest pain with pcp asan outpatient.2. we recommend that the patient have a pharmacologic stress test as anoutpatient to evaluate for possible areas of potential cardiac ischemia.no dictated summaryentered by: pursifull , lincoln b. , m.d.

phosphatase of 284 , altof 82 , total bilirubin of 4.0 , direct bilirubin of 2.0 , albuminof 2.5 and an inr of 2.1. cxr reveals a rll pneumonia.hospital course:1. aspiration pneumonia. the patient was admitted with a rightlower lobe pneumonia. she grew mrsa in her sputum and wastreated with vancomycin , levofloxacin and flagyl. she did welland was extubated on her first hospital day after arriving in themicu. however , she continued to aspirate and failed a bedsideswallow study in the micu. she was stabilized and transported tothe medicine floor on overnight bipap. she again failed bedsideswallow evaluation with thin liquids , and was therefore startedon a very conservative pudding thick puree diet. she didsubsequently aspirate on secretions ( she was not eating at thattime ) and became acutely hypoxic with an abg that showed a ph of7.45 , pco2 of 48 and a po2 of 36. her family was brought in andit was explained that the patient was recurrently aspirating andwas critically ill. a family meeting was held , where it wasdecided that the patient would be dnr/dni , and every attemptwould be made to bring the patient home with hospice. sheactually stabilized from her acute event and was able to weanfrom bipap to 3 l oxygen nasal cannula. nevertheless , thepatient's family understood that her respiratory status remainedtenuous and that she would likely re-aspirate. she wasdischarged home with hospice services per family request.2. chf. the patient diuresed greater than 26 liters during thisadmission. much of this diuresis was without pharmacologicalintervention , although she did receive minimal lasix support. atthe time of discharge , she was tending towards euvolemic or dry and wasnot on any lasix. she was felt to be in the polyuric phase ofatn , which was resolving.3. diabetes. the patient was discharged on insulin nph and asliding scale regular insulin. her doses have been decreasedbecause she was found to be hypoglycemic on admission.4. atrial fibrillation on coumadin. given the patient's historyof bleeding ( she had a gi bleeding while in the micu in thesetting of an inr of 2.0 ) , coumadin was held. on review with themedical team , it was felt that the risk of stroke was faroutweighed by the risk of a significant bleed. therefore , thepatient is not discharged on coumadin.5. acute renal failure. the patient was treated withantibiotics prior to this admission , and developed atn secondaryto that medication. of note , her urine was positive foreosinophils on admission. at the time of discharge , thepatient's creatinine was 2.1 , which in part was due to atn andalso due to significant diuresis. her baseline creatinine is 1.7and she is currently trending downwards.6. thrombocytopenia. the patient is noted to have a chronicthrombocytopenia. this was exacerbated with heparin products ,which were discontinued. she did require platelet transfusionsfor a platelet count of 34 in the setting of acute bright redblood per rectum. however , her platelet count was stable atgreater than 125 on discharge.7. lft abnormalities. a right upper quadrant ultrasound waswithin normal limits , although was of poor quality given thepatient's obese body habitus. she does have a possiblecholestatic picture , but the patient had no other symptoms.given her dnr/dni status with hospice services pending , nofurther workup was performed.8. agitation. the patient is , at baseline , mourning anddisoriented , but responsive. she did require haldol and ativanp.r.n. , but also did well with 1 to 1 interaction. morphine wasadequate for pain control.9. speech and swallow evaluation. the patient failed severalspeech and swallow evaluations. she is put on a pudding thickpuree diet , but this is palliative , as she will very likelyaspirate even on this diet.10. rheumatoid arthritis. the patient was continued onprednisone 20 mg q.a.m.discharge examination: temperature 96 , respiratory rate 22 ,pulse 68 , blood pressure 130/60 , oxygen saturation 99% on 3liters. exam is notable for morbid obesity , coarse breathsounds , right greater than left , large ecchymosis of varyingstages particularly at subcutaneous injection sites , and baselinedisorientation , which is not different from the patient's usualmental status.laboratory studies on discharge: white count 11 , hematocrit 33 ,platelets 214 , 000 ,

that was debrided in 2000 , achilles repairin 1975 , and right knee surgery in 1965.social history: he does not smoke. he rarely drinks alcohol ,and denied initial drug surgery.physical examination on admission: his initial height was 5 feet9-1/2 inches. his weight was 318 pounds on admission.past medical history: he came to miwest child university medical centerfor an attempted lap banding on 7/30/2005 .  unfortunately duringthe surgery , there was damage to the thoracic aorta and theattempted lap banding turned into an exploratory laparotomy ,median sternotomy , left thoracotomy , and aortic injury repair.he suffered cardiac arrest on the operating room table. lefthemothorax and cardiac tamponade secondary to the descendingthoracic aortic laceration which was repaired intraoperatively ,and his abdomen was left open temporarily with a ??____?? bag andpartial vac sponge , and he was admitted to the unit on pressors.hospital course: notable for a couple of major events over thepast couple of months , and we will go to those major events. on7/25/2005 , mr. benck was weaned off pressors. on the10/15/2005 , the mediastinal chest tube was discontinued. on1/2/2005 , his creatinine started to increase. on 4/15/2005and 10/12/2005 , the patient was bronched for respiratory distresswith resolution of the respiratory distress. on 10/18/2005 , hewas taken down to the operating room to increase the size of theendotracheal tube. his abdominal wound dehisced en route , a jtube was placed , a left triple lumen catheter was placed , and hisexploratory laparotomy wound was able to be closed with waxsponge to be on top of the wound closure. on 4/30/2005 , he hada tap of his left chest. there was fluid collection there fromthe left thoracotomy. on 8/8/2005 , the left chest tube wasplaced and on 1/11/2005 , a left chest tube was discontinued. on2/7/2005 , he was trached and two chest tubes were placed and aleft vats was completed again , because of a persisted fluidcollection. on 4/24/2005 , a right picc was placed and thetriple lumen and his a line were discontinued. on 6/10/2005 , atee was done that showed normal valves with no vegetations and nomajor regional wall motion abnormalities. on 9/30/2005 , histrach was changed to a #7. on 2/10/3005 , his trach was changedto a #8 portex. on 11/28/2005 , he had a renal ultrasound foragain a slowly rising creatinine that did not show any evidenceof hydronephrosis. on 3/23/2005 , cvvh was started after quintonwas placed in the right ij , on 5/4/2005 , his #8 portex trachwas replaced with a #8 shiley. on 10/18/2205 , a clot developedin the cvvh catheter. on 1/25/2005 , a wound which was beingseen periodically by i&d has had periodic wound i&ds and vacchanges. on 6/23/2005 , the right ij quinton was discontinuedand a right ij tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed. on2/7/2005 , he had a metabolic heart and began to trach collarfor increasing amounts of time. on 9/20/2005 and 12 ,there was report that his j tube had been slightly displaced andthen had been pushed in by the icu team. the patient developedleft lower quadrant pain. he was sent down for the ct of theabdomen and pelvis , and now the j tube was not fully visualized ithink because it is radiolucent to extravasation of contrast wasnot seen and surgery team felt that it was okay to continue tubefeeds safely which we have with no problems. on 6/16/2005 , hedesaturated when he went down for an ultrasound for the leftupper extremity in order to rule out clot because again the leftupper extremity had been swelling , so no studies was completed.he developed rigor short after with the temperature to 104 , somemild hypotension and tachycardia. tee at the bedside show nodissection or intimal flap blood cultures were drawn. his piccwas discontinued and the tip was sent for culture , and hereceived doses of levofloxacin and vancomycin. he was able toeventually j-collar through this. on 3/26/2005 , a 3 out of 4gram negative rods which ended up being enterobacter werecultured out. we believe that he suffered a transient bacteremiafrom the picc. levofloxacin was started and id was consultedbecause the enterobacter was resistant about everything exceptamikacin and imipenem. on 10/3/2005 , allergy was also consultedand restarted an imipenem desensitization process which he hascompleted , and he is now on imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours for atotal course of 15 days that was started on 10/3/2005 , and apicc was replaced. today , he was planning to go to hemodialysisin order to exchange the dialysis catheter over wire not that itis not functioning but because of this transient bacteremia wewould like to give them a new hemodialysis catheter. he has beenable to get hemodialysis with , though some 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 unitsof heparin has to be given beforehand in order for the cathetersto flush well , and he will also be going for left upper extremityeither ultrasound or venogram to again rule out a clot in theleft upper extremity due to the increased swelling. his lasttemperature here is 98.3 today. his blood pressure runssystolics 90 to 110 with a heart rate in the 90s to 110s. he ison no drips or iv fluids , just his full strength nepro of 55which is his goal and he is essentially anuric , but when we dostraight caths which we tend to do once every 1-2 days , he putsout usually 100-200 cc of urine and he has been j-collaringsuccessfully now for over three or four days saturations in the95% to 100% and an fio2 of 40%. ot and pt have also been seeinghim.review of systems:neurologically , his mental status has much improved. he hadinitially some icu delirium after the initial surgery that hasreally greatly improved. he right now is on no major moodstabilizers or antipsychotics. we do give him oxycodone forpain , which he really has had to use.pulmonarywise , we have kept him on j-collar when he does need togo for a procedure we do send down the vent in case just becausehe is still fairly large person and may need the ventilatorysupport for positioning. he is right now on combivent and duonebnebulizers p.r.n.cardiovascularwise , his blood pressure has been stable and so hashis tachycardia. the beta-blocker that he was initially onlopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. was stopped secondary to the imipenemdesensitization the feeling being that if he did has ananaphylactic reaction , the epinephrine needed unopposed actionand we did not want any beta-blocker on board. we have held andwould continue it starting at a low dose after he completes hiscourse of imipenem.gastrointestinalwise , he is on tube feeds which he tolerates verywell and there are no issues any more with the j-tube position.we are requesting a bedside speech and swallow official consult ,though he has been tolerating ice chips and ice cream withabsolutely no problems on p.o. he is also on pepcid iv for giprophylaxis.genitourinarywise , he gets hemodialysis every other day. theyhave been taking 4-5 liters per day and again with straightcatheterizing once every 1-2 days and usually get about a 100 ccto 200 cc of urine. renal has been following him , and they areunhappy with his course of dialysis. again , the hemodialysiscatheter is to be wire exchanged today , which is 11/5/2005 , butagain they have been able to use it just fine so far.hematologywise , he is on heparin subcutaneous 10 , 000 units t.i.d.endocrinewise , we have been checking his fingersticks and he isright now on lantus 15 units subcutaneous b.i.d. with a slidingscale for coverage. he has just been following the fingersticksthat way and imipenem , he is to continue for 14-day course totalof imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours. the first dose was given inthe a.m. on 10/3/2005 , and there are no new culture resultsafter the gram-negative enterobacter was found. all othersurveillance and urine culture have been negative.escription document: 5-1134888 mffocusdictated by: cremins , hershelattending:

tubeinsertion.brief hospital course from 10/27/06 through 9/10/06:neuro: the patient was maintained on oxycodone per ng tubeinitially and then per g-tube for analgesia. she also receivedseroquel for agitation and hallucinations. upon discharge torehabilitation , the patient was alert and oriented , moves allextremities and following commands. she had good pain control onoxycodone elixir and seroquel.cardiovascular: the patient remained hemodynamically stableafter her initial septic event. she remained in a normal sinusrhythm for the remainder of her icu course. she was maintainedon lopressor 100 per per g-tube q.i.d. her pressures toleratedthis dose.pulmonary: the patient continued on bipap failing each trial offthe bipap. she would become tachypneic and desaturate withelevation of her pco2 once off bipap. after several days offbipap trials , the decision was made and discussed with the familyand the patient regarding her need for tracheostomy. it wasexplained to her that tidal volumes were low and would drop offbipap and that she would benefit from a tracheostomy placement.the patient was consented and informed and taken to the operatingroom on 4/16/06 where she underwent a tracheostomy. shetolerated the procedure well. she was quickly weaned to pressuresupport ventilation. she was maintained on minimal vent settingsfor a couple of days postoperatively. she was eventually trachcollared , as she has been over the last three to four days. thepatient does tire out after two to three hours of trach collar ,after which we placed her back to pressure support ventilation.the patient has also had some mild bilateral pleural effusion onchest x-ray that has not progressed and has been stablethroughout her course. the patient has a history of obstructivesleep apnea and copd at baseline. the patient received inhalerand nebulizers standing and p.r.n. she will need to continue hertrach collar trials most likely having more trach collar trialsat smaller intervals. the patient's current vent settings upondischarge to rehabilitation are pressure support 5 and 10 , tidalvolumes 350-400 , breathing at a rate of 23 , and saturating 99% onan fio2 of 40%.gi: patient's abdomen remained stable with a vac sponge. shehad her vac sponge changed as needed twice a week with goodgranulation tissue forming. there were no signs of infection.due to the patient's respiratory failure and need fortracheostomy , patient also underwent a peg placement on 2/18/06 .she tolerated this procedure well. medications were started onthe day of surgery and her tube feeds were resumed onpostoperative day #1 from her peg. the patient is currentlyreceiving two cal formula tube feeds at a rate of 45 , which isher goal rate. she should continue on that. the patient may bechanged to jevity if she needs more fluid volume. the patient'sabdomen is soft , vac sponge in place to suction and draining ,ostomy is functioning well and viable with good output. thepatient should continue on a h2 blocker for a ppi while on thevent.gu: the patient is still somewhat fluid overloaded most likelydue to third spacing due to poor nutrition andhyperprolactinemia. the patient was aggressively diuresedthroughout her stay with the lasix drip , and albumin and albuminand lasix combination. over the last few days prior to dischargeto rehab , the patient has

difficulty ambulating secondary to the pain. ct scan of thethoracic and lumbar spine on may , 2003 were negative forabscess. the patient had no fevers. his admission exam was benignwith no aortic insufficiency and normal neurological exam. therewas variable pain to palpation over the ribs with no pain topalpation over the spine. the patient was managed conservativelywith oxycodone , motrin and baclofen. he was initially admitted togms , and troponin was initially positive at 0.12 and then becamenegative.1. infectious disease: blood cultures drawn on march , 2003grew 2/2 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs. dueto concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis or potential epiduralabscess , the patient was transferred to cardiology. infectiousdisease consult was obtained. vancomycin and gentamicin werestarted on march , 2003. on october , 2003 a transesophagealechocardiogram was negative for vegetation. a mri of the spine wasnegative for osteomyelitis , epidural abscess however the mri didshow severe degenerative joint disease possibly causing thepatient's back pain. the patient has had numerous positive bloodcultures for streptococcus sanguous ( viridans

negativeabdominal ct ( which did show a small liver cyst ) , negative taggedwhite blood cell count scan and a negative back mri. dentalconsult saw no abscesses thus no evidence of a large septic sourcefrom the mouth although this particular bacteria raises suspicionfor an oral source. repeat films and dental evaluation on november , 2003 required the patient to get teeth cleaning as anoutpatient. there is a question of some seeding from bleeding gumsthat occur about once weekly while the patient is brushing frompoor dentition and gum care. the dentist recommended deep cleaningas

m.d.admission condition: stable.admission diagnosis: foley trauma.history of present illness: this is a 61-year-old male withhypotension , diabetes , and obesity. he was in his usual state ofhealth until november , 2006 , when he had a sudden loss of functionof his lower upper extremity and lower right extremity. he wasadmitted to lihiltcat medical center neurology service , wherean mri revealed a right internal capsule lacunar stroke. he wasout of the tpa window. as a result , he was treated with aspirinand statin. an echo showed a normal ef and no evidence ofthrombosis. there was no evidence of a-fib. his hospitalcourse , however , was complicated with foley trauma and hematuriafor which he required continuous bladder irrigation. the patientalso developed a uti by ua , but not a positive culture data. thepatient was seen briefly by urology , who recommended continuedbladder irrigation and followup. he was then treated withceftazidime x3 and the patient was discharged to rehab on novemberwith a chronic bladder irrigation and urology followup for a uturogram.the patient did fairly well in rehab until the day prior toadmission , which was on november , 2006 , after one day of beingdischarged from rehab when , during a physical therapy session ,the patient accidentally manipulated the foley catheter causingincreased pain and worsening hematuria. so , then the patientcame to the ed the next day after the patient was alreadydischarged. the patient came to the ed on november , 2006. thepatient was hemodynamically stable but complained of severepelvic pain and received 10 mg of iv morphine , dilaudid ,percocet , valium and ativan. the patient then becameincreasingly sedated and developed an o2 requirement , and waseventually on lung non-rebreather. by the time he was admittedto the medicine floor , the patient was very sedated and difficultto arouse. abgs showed a 7.25/71/90 and he received 0.04 mg ofnarcan. he immediately awoke; however , then continued to becomesedated within 30 minutes. as a result , the patient was sent toicu on may , 2006. the patient had systolic blood pressure inthe 60s and was given narcan and iv fluids. however , thesystolic pressure only responded to 90s. the patient alsocomplained of diffuse abdominal pain. however , kub showed anonspecific bowel gas pattern. the patient was required tocontinue narcan boluses and his abg started to show improvement.it was 7.33/56/113 on 100% non-rebreather. during the overnighticu stay , the patient did very well. eventually , the patient washemodynamically stable with systolic pressure maintaining verywell over 100 with a jvp over 10. the patient was more awake thenext day after admission to icu overnight.hospital course by systemcardiovascular: as a result , the patient was hypotensive on thefloor at the beginning due to being over-narcotized in the ed.systolic pressure dropped to the lowest in the 60s. however ,after the icu stay , as well as boluses with narcan iv fluids , thepatient's blood pressure returned to be stable , with systolicblood pressure above 100. the patient's echo was also normal theweek before and there were no signs of systolic dysfunction. thepatient was continued on aspirin and statin and , after the icustay , the patient was transferred back to the floor and thepatient's cardiovascular was stable and the patient'santihypertensive regimen was resumed. the patient's heart ratewas usually maintained between 50 to 67. at times , the patient'slopressor has to be held due to the low heart rate. as a result ,lopressor was titrated down from 25 mg to 12.5 mg b.i.d. thishappened during the hospital stay. the patient also resumed backon his captopril 6.25 mg t.i.d. the patient was admitted to thefloor on telemetry and throughout the 3-4 days prior todischarge , the patient was stable on the floor and remainedcardiovascularly and hemodynamically stable. the patient wascontinued on statin and aspirin.pulmonary: the patient has weaned off the non-rebreather afterthe stay from icu and has been satting well between 96-97% on 3-4liters. the patient's lungs have remained cleared and thepatient's lasix has resumed at 20 mg daily due to the patienthaving a negative lasix of 40 mg daily. the patient was resumedback to his original regimen upon discharge. the patient has hadminimal crackles during his stay here in the hospital.infectious disease: the patient was given vancomycin andceftazidime in the setting of hypotension and concern forpossible sepsis at the beginning. however , due to no growth todate with the blood cultures , the infectious etiology ofhypotension is unlikely. as a result , antibiotics were notcontinued when the patient was transferred back to the floor.urology: the patient continued to have hematuria upon admissionto the micu , likely secondary to foley trauma. the patientcontinued to have chronic continued bladder irrigation for thefollowing two days after discharge from the micu. under theevaluation by the urologist , the patient does not need chronicbladder irrigation anymore. the urologist suggested that thebladder has actually stopped bleeding with clear urine drained.of note , the patient was very agitated at one point on the secondday upon discharge from the micu and pulled the foley out , whichcreated a trauma to the bladder neck. however , the bleedingstopped very quickly and the urologist placed a second foley intothe bladder without any complications. urology recommended thatthe patient be followed by dr. anderson veley as an outpatient. intheir opinion , the patient does not have any urological symptoms ,and the patient should have the foley for the following 4-5weeks. per urology , the patient may not be able to control hisbladder due to the stroke that the patient had the week before ,so the patient will need chronic foley for the next 4-5 weeksuntil followup with the urologist in the office. the patient'shematocrit has been stable at 29 throughout the hospital stay.endocrinology: the patient has a history of diabetes andcontinued to have nph and subcutaneous heparin.renal: the patient had prerenal azotemia at one point prior totransfer to the floor due to hypotension. however , the patient'screatinine recovered dramatically from 1.5 to 0.7 upon discharge.the patient also had an obstruction in which the patient wasunable to void , which created a postrenal azotemia at one time ,but both prerenal and postrenal azotemia have resolved upondischarge.neuro: mental status intact. the patient has been doing verythroughout the two days prior to discharge. the patient wasalert and oriented x3. however , the patient occasionallycomplained about the leg pain from the side in which the patienthas lost motor function. the patient remained to have lefthemiparesis and required 100 mg neurontin t.i.d. for pain controlregimen. otherwise , the patient was evaluated by both , will befollowed by neurology on april , 2006.diet: the patient had normal cardiac diet and the patient willcontinue on the diet when the patient is discharged to rehab.prophylaxis: the patient should resume his lovenox 40 mg dailyand the patient should have aspirin and nexium for prophylaxis.psychiatry: the patient was given ambien 10 mg p.o. at bedtimefor sleep and he responded very well with the regimen. thepatient was also given seroquel for anti-anxiety

patient was immediately startedon diuretics with torsemide iv 100 mg twice a day with a goal of-1 to -2 liters daily. daily weights and strict i & os weremonitored daily. the patient was also placed on 1 liter freewater restriction and 2 liters fluid restriction. digoxin levelswere shown to be in normal range. the patient was continued ondigoxin , isordil , and thiazides were held secondary to patient'shyponatremia. over the hospital course , the patient'shyponatremia improved significantly and gradually back up in tothe 130s. the patient continued to diurese well initially with aweight of 83.5 kilograms. at the time of discharge , thepatient's weight was approximately 273 kilograms. the patientalso continued to show much improvement in terms of energy level.subjectively , the patient felt better. zestril was also slowlyadded to patient's chf regimen. at the time of discharge ,zestril 10 mg per day was added. a beta-blocker was also added ,specifically coreg at 3.125 mg twice daily , aldactone 25 mg oncedaily was also added to the regimen. in terms of diuresisinitially , the patient was on 100 mg b.i.d. p.o. torsemide and atone point was switched to lasix drip as the patient was notresponding to diuretics. eventually the patient was transitionedback to an oral regimen with torsemide ultimately at 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.echocardiogram was also performed which showed significant mitralregurgitation with reversal of flow in the pulmonary venoussystem. as a result , there was consideration and discussionabout mitral valve replacement. the patient is amenable toprocedure performed by dr. mcgrue this will be discussed andcoordinated by his office and him. this will be a percutaneousprocedure possibly.the patient's electrolytes were monitored twice daily as thepatient was actively being diuresed. electrolytes were repletedp.r.n.b. rhythm: the patient has no active arrhythmias. however , thepatient's icd and biventricular pacemaker was found to be towardsend of life and required replacement. as a result , although noturgent during this admission , icd/biventricular pacer wasreplaced by dr. neuse on 4/20/05. the patient tolerated theprocedure very well with no complications. the patient's icdpocket was checked for any signs of pocket hematoma or othercomplications. the patient is stable and new icd/pacer isfunctioning properly. no signs of bleeding or infection.c. ischemia: there are no active issues. ekgs demonstrated nosigns of cardiac ischemia. the patient was chest pain freethroughout the hospitalization.2. endocrine: the patient's home regimen was held and thepatient was continued only on a insulin sliding scale after mealsand at bedtime. fingersticks demonstrated good sugar control.fingersticks were managed mostly between 100 and 120.3. fen: the patient was on diabetic diet. the patient was alsochecked twice daily for electrolytes and repleted for magnesiumand potassium scale. sodium was also monitored as the patientwas initially admitted for hyponatremia. as a result , allthiazides were held.4. hematology: the patient had a home dose of coumadin 5 mgmonday , wednesday , friday. the patient's regimen was continuedas inpatient and was slightly modified eventually toapproximately 2 to 2.5 mg once daily. inr was maintainedtherapeutic throughout the hospitalization. icd replacementprocedure per dr. bjella the patient was

, the patient was on coumadinwith therapeutic inr. for gi prophylaxis , the patient was placedon nexium.physical therapy consult was also called to evaluate thepatient's functional status. the patient also underwent regularphysical therapy sessions inhouse to improve functional status.id: the patient's ua demonstrated possible evidence for urinarytract infection. this may also have contributed to patient'sdecompensated heart failure and also initial complaints offeeling weak. urine culture demonstrated that the patient hadcitrobacter that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. as a result ,the patient was started on a course of ciprofloxacin. thepatient was also placed in isolation as the strain was resistantto gentamicin. the patient after treatment was taken off contactisolation. the patient was afebrile. vital signs were stablewith no complaints of dysuria , chills , or fevers throughouthospitalization. subsequent ua demonstrated evidence thaturinary tract infection was adequately treated.disposition:the patient to follow up with home cardiologist within one to twoweeks. after discharge , the patient will also follow up with dr.iturbe to discuss further treatment of

illness:the patient is a 58-year-old woman with medical history asmentioned above and history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with herlast echocardiogram in 6/22 showing ejection fraction of 35-45%.she presents with approximately 1.5 weeks of increasingshortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. the patient denieschest pain , fevers or chills but does say that she has had sorethroat and a cough for approximately one week. the cough isproductive of clear frothy sputum. the patient reportscompliance with most of her medicines but states that she is nottaking synthroid and lisinopril because these medications makeher feel bad. she also reports eating submarine sandwiches forthe past week secondary to difficulty shopping and doing hercooking at home. she does not measure her daily weights. shestates that in addition to the synthroid and lisinopril , she isunsure of her other medical regimen as she has run out of some ofher medicines at home.past medical history:as

approximately two times per month.admission data:vital signs: temperature 97 , pulse 76 , blood pressure 150s/80s.note that one read with a small cuff read a blood pressure of200/100 , this was believed to be secondary to inefficient cuffsize. oxygen saturation 94% on room air. in general , thepatient is morbidly obese , in no acute distress , slowlyresponsive to questions with frequent

heart failure and decompensation.summary of hospital course:1. cardiovascular:pump: the patient presented with an elevated jvp in the settingof a negative bnp. however the clinical exam was more consistentwith mild failure and the patient was diuresed with 80 mg of ivlasix. she responded to this dose with good urine output andstable renal function test. however , secondary to stressincontinence and difficulty measuring jvp , the patient wasslightly over diuresed while inhouse resulting in an increasingbun to creatinine ratio. on her final day of herhospitalization , all diuretics were held and the patient wasdischarged on her usual regimen of diuretics including lasix 80mg once per day. the patient had been noncompliant with herlisinopril secondary to throat symptoms and reportedly somelightheadedness. therefore she was changed to cozaar 50 mg atthe time of discharge. the patient's discharge weight was 141.5kg and this was estimated to be dry weight for the patient atthis time.rhythm: the patient had first degree av block that was stablefrom old ekgs. she was monitored on telemetry throughout herhospital stay. there were no significant events on telemetryduring this hospitalization.ischemia: rule out mi protocol was initiated in the ed secondaryto vague symptoms. this was continued and the patient ruled outwith serial negative cardiac enzymes x 3. there was nosuggestion of ischemic by ecg criteria as well.2. endocrine: the patient has a long history of noncompliancewith her thyroid hormone replacement and was clearly hypothyroidon this admission. however , secondary to difficulty with blooddraws , thyroid function tests that were ordered were not obtainedon this admission and should be obtained as an outpatient in thenear future. the patient was encouraged to continue taking herthyroid medicine as this may help improve her overall functionalstatus in addition to her cardiomyopathy.discharge medications:lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. ,

respectively , who presented on 7/16/2000 with afour day history of cough , fevers , chills , myalgias and left eyepain. the patient also noted over the course of four days prior toadmission , that his p.o. intake had been decreasing. he had beenexperiencing nausea and vomiting without diarrhea and fevers to 103degrees. on the day of admission the patient noted the suddenonset of vision loss in his left eye associated with redness andpain. in the emergency room the patient was given diamox , aspirinand nitropaste in response to t-wave inversions anteriorly on hiselectrocardiogram. in addition , the patient was cultured andstarted on broad spectrum antibiotics including ceftriaxone ,azithromycin and gentamycin.physical exam: vital signs: temperature 99.2 , heart rate 60 ,blood

troponin 1.7 , cbc showed a white blood cell countof 5.5 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 51. electrocardiogram showedpaced rate of 60 with t-wave inversions of v1-v6. chest x-rayshowed cardiomegaly with vascular redistribution. no focalinfiltrates noted. ct of the head showed no evidence of acutebleed. urinalysis essentially negative.hospital course: 1. infectious disease: the patient wasinitially treated with broad spectrum antibioticsin the emergency room and was rapidly noted to be hypotensive witha systolic blood pressure in the 72. the patient was hydratedaggressively and consistently pan cultured. the patient began tospike fevers from 100 to 101 range. on the second hospital day ,the patient grew 4/4 bottles of what turned out to be group b streptococcus.the patient's antibiotics were changed to penicillin and gentamycin. atransesophageal echocardiogram was performed on the day ofadmission and did not demonstrate any vegetation , however withpersistent high spiking fevers , sepsis and 4/4 blood culturebottles , repeated blood cultures growing gbs the patient had repeattransesophageal echocardiogram. this demonstrated a 1.5x1.0centimeter vegetation on the anterior annulus of the tricuspidvalve and it was also noted to be hitting the pacemaker wire thoughnot fixed to it. of note , the bubble study on the echocardiogramwas negative for patent foramen ovale.the patient presented complaining of left eye pain and loss ofvision on the night of admission in the emergency room , theophthalmologist saw the patient and determined that the patient hadan elevated pressure. the elevated pressure was treated and heresponded well by the following day. at that time the patient'seye was aspirated and noted to also be infected by gbs. thepatient was injected intraocular with vancomycin at that time.unfortunately the patient continued to spike fever despiteappropriate therapy for his gbs and his eye appeared to beworsening with continued erythema , conjunctival edema and apurulent exudate. it was determined that the patient would requireenucleation which he underwent on 5/10/2000.the patient also had a right lower extremity cellulitis during hishospital course. this was treated with a ten day course ofdicloxacillin and resolved without complications. the patient'scourse was complicated by persistent fevers despite appropriateantibiotic therapy and left eye enucleation. an extensive work upwas undertaken to evaluate the fevers including evaluation forpossible epidural abscess , psoas abscess and infected joints. noneof these proved to be a source. the patient underwent multiplejoint aspirations ( see musculoskeletal section below ) without clearevidence of infection. the patient also underwent a tagged whiteblood cell scan which demonstrated increased uptake in the leftshoulder , manubrium , right knee , left ankle and mid shaft of theleft tibia. these were interpreted both on the initial views anddelayed views as consistent with acute inflammation but notdiagnostic of infection. as mentioned above the patient was alsotreated for cellulitis and underwent left eye enucleation. thepatient's fever curve trended down throughout the hospital stay andon the day prior to admission , the patient underwent a repeattransesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there was nomyocardial abscess. there was no evidence of any abscess and thevegetation was no longer visible. it was felt that the low gradefevers were secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acuteinfectious process at the time of discharge. the patient's lastpositive blood culture was 4/3/2000.of note , there was concern that the patient's fever could besecondary to a drug reaction. therefore once the infectious workup was completed , the penicillin was changed to vancomycin. hisgram positive coverage will need to be continued for four weeksafter his left eye enucleation.2. ophthalmology: as described above , the patient presented withleft eye pain and vision loss. it was felt from the time ofpresentation that the patient would not recover vision in his lefteye. the patient was treated initially for his elevated pressureand then the following day his eye was aspirated and injected withvancomycin. ultimately the patient had left eye enucleation. thepatient's eye healed well through the remainder of his hospitalcourse and does not appear to be a source of infection thereafter.the patient's extraocular muscles were left intact with the thoughtof placing a prosthesis at a later date.3. cardiovascular: on admission the patient was noted to havet-wave inversions anteriorly on his electrocardiogram. however itrapidly became clear that his pacemaker was malfunctioningdemonstrating only occasional pacing spikes. by 6/24/2000 thepacemaker was no longer capturing or sensing. as mentioned above ,the wire did not appear to be incorporated in the vegetation notedon the tricuspid valve however it did appear that the vegetationwas hitting the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole. on6/13/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation withoutcomplications.the indication for pacemaker placement had been for bradycardia.there was some concern throughout the patient's hospital coursethat the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker inplace however this never manifested as a problem. he diddemonstrate some runs of ventricular tachycardia during the earlyphase of his hospital course but this resolved as his sepsisresolved. he did have one episode of supraventricular tachycardiathought to be 1-1 conduction of his atrial arrhythmia. hislopressor was increased in response to this and the patient wastolerating this dose without episodes of bradycardia orhypotension.the patient as mentioned above , underwent a transesophagealechocardiogram at the time of admission which demonstrated anejection fraction of 35 percent , apical hypokinesis , moderatelydilated right ventricle with moderately depressed systolicfunction. mild inferior vena cava dilatation consistent withelevated right heart filling pressures. the patient's cardiacfunction appeared to be stable throughout his hospitalization. hedid rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission.4. musculoskeletal: one of the patient's major presentingcomplaints was significant arthralgia and myalgia. it was thoughthat along with left ophthalmitis , the patient could have septicpolyarthritis. the patient underwent several arthrocentesis by therheumatology service. though the fluid did demonstrate elevatedwhite blood cell count it was never clear that these were acutelyinfected. there were no bacteria on gram stain or culture. thepatient's right knee continued to be tender , erythematous and warmduring the initial part of the hospitalization. therefore thepatient went to arthroscopic examination on 7/16/2000. thepatient's knee was lavaged with 9 liters of sterile saline prior toclosing all of the effusion was drained. there were nocomplications. the patient continued to have symptoms of right kneeeffusion and pain and therefore returned to the operating room on10/28/2000 for repeat arthrocentesis. since that time the rightknee has reaccumulated a moderate sized effusion but the patienthas tolerated physical therapy and has regained a moderate amountof his range of motion. it was determined that the patient shouldnot have this effusion drained again because it was no longer warmor erythematous.the left shoulder was also quite tender during the initial hospitalstay. the patient underwent multiple joint aspirations of theglenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints , both at the bed side andunder fluoroscopic examination. again , this joint demonstratedelevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence thatit was a septic joint.the patient after his left eye enucleation , was noted to have anelevated ck of 1522. it was thought that this was an insignificantmb fraction. it was not felt that there was enough manipulation toskeletal muscles during the enucleation to warrant this. this risein ck did coincide with increased muscle aches. it was felt thatthe patient perhaps had a mild episode of rhabdomyolysis whichresolved quickly to a ck of 177 five days later.at the time of discharge the patient is experiencing no myalgias orarthralgias with the exception of the right knee which is stillsomewhat limited in its range of motion and demonstrates aneffusion but is responding well to rehabilitation.5. pulmonary: the patient was quite stable from a pulmonarystandpoint throughout his hospitalization. the patient wasinitially maintained in the emergency room on high flow oxygenhowever was quickly weaned to nasal cannula and then room air. thepatient does have obstructive sleep apnea and used his bipap atnight throughout his hospitalization.6. hematology: on admission the patient demonstrated athrombocytopenia with a nadir of 51. this has improved throughouthis hospital course and on the day of discharge his platelets werenoted to be 538.the patient was noted to have hematocrit that trended down andcorresponded to some guaiac positive stools with anticoagulation.the patient received a total of four units of packed red bloodcells. his hematocrit has remained stable with a good reticulocytecount at the time of discharge.the patient was anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillationinitially with heparin and then ultimately with coumadin 10 mg p.o.q hs. the patient's inr has been therapeutic in the 2-3 range forapproximately five days.7. renal: on admission the patient was noted to have an elevatedcreatinine from his baseline of 1.0. this was thought to besecondary to dehydration and prerenal azotemia. the patient'screatinine reached a peak of 3.0 and stabilized at 1.3 at the timeof discharge. this appears to have resolved entirely withresolution of sepsis and rehydration.8. fluids/electrolytes/nutrition: the patient was significantdehydrated at the time of admission. this responded rapidly to invitro fertilization. he also regained his appetite as his sepsisresolved. the patient is noted however to have a very pooralbumen , which is 2.3 at the time of discharge. the patient willrequire improved nutrition at rehabilitation and after dischargefrom rehabilitation. the patient's electrolytes were relativelystable throughout his hospital stay.9. endocrine: the patient has a long standing history of type iidiabetes mellitus. on admission , he was taking metformin 1000 mgp.o. b.i.d. , regular insulin 10 q a.m. and 10 q p.m. , nph insulin25 q a.m. and 20 q p.m. his hemoglobin a1-c was noted to beelevated at 8.1 in 11/15 the patient's metformin was heldthroughout his hospital stay with the anticipation of possibleinvasive procedures. he is maintained and nph insulin as well assliding scale insulin. the patient was restarted on his metforminprior to discharge and increased dose of nph insulin. this willlikely need to be adjusted as the patient recovers further.10. gastrointestinal: the patient did develop guaiac positivestools during his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. thiswill need to be followed up as an outpatient once the patient hasmade a full recovery from the acute event. also the patient diddemonstrate a mild transaminitis during his hospital stay and thisappears to have resolved with the transition from penicillin tovancomycin for his antibiotic regimen.medications on discharge: colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ilotycin0.5% topical t.i.d. over left eyelid ,lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d.

negative.procedures: september , 2000 , endometrial biopsy. the procedurewas limited due to the patient's body habitus. thebiopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy. complications none.hospital course: by systems:1. genitourinary. the patient's presentingsymptoms and abdominal ct findings of bilateral adnexal masses weresuspicious for a tubo-ovarian abscess. however , the patient didnot have any of the associated risk factors , given that the patientis not sexually active and denied introducing any foreign objectsinto the vagina. the patient was initially managed on tripleantibiotics , ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin. since a ctscan is not the optimal test to evaluate the adnexa , a transvaginalultrasound was ordered which revealed endometrial thickness of 3.6mm and bilateral cystic masses. the patient's right upper quadrantpain and tenderness persisted for several days during the admissionwith periodic exacerbations and was increasingly suspicious forcholelithiasis or pancreatitis. the patient then had an abdominalultrasound which was essentially was within normal limits andshowed no abnormal viscera. the bilateral adnexal masses continuedto be of major concern , and interventional radiology was consultedfor possible aspiration. given that the etiology of the masses wasunclear and the risk of malignancy in a post menopausal woman , itwas decided that the best approach would be open tissue sampling.it was then decided to postpone this procedure pending furtherevaluation of the patient. of note , the patient had a ca-125 drawnwhich 77. serum hcg was negative. the patient's report of newonset of post menopausal bleeding was concerning. considering thehigh likelihood of malignancy , the patient was being followed bythe gynecology oncology service and underwent endometrial biopsyfor tissue sampling. the biopsy revealed no evidence ofmalignancy. the patient had a repeat ct scan on hospital daynumber seven which was essentially unchanged from admission showingpersistent bilateral adnexal masses and no free fluid. thepatient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain persisted butbecame more responsive to treatment toward the end of theadmission. throughout the admission the actual etiology of thebilateral adnexal masses was never discerned. as a result , thepatient was referred to the gynecology oncology service forcontinued follow up as an outpatient.2. infectious disease. the patient's presentation of fevers ,chills , and diaphoresis was certainly suspicious for infectiousprocess. initially the patient was covered with ampicillin ,gentamicin , and clindamycin for empiric antimicrobial coverage.the urine culture was notable for greater than 100 , 000 escherichiacoli which was pan sensitive. all blood cultures at initialpresentation had been negative. on october , the creatininelevel increased to 1.8. as a result , gentamicin was then switchedto levofloxacin. the patient's fever initially defervesced from102.2 to 99.3 , but spiked to 100.1 after six days of antibiotics.her white blood cell count remained elevated and ranged from 24 to32. however , by discharge the white blood cell count was 10.because of the patient's initial minimal response to antibiotics ,repeat blood cultures and urine cultures were sent which werenegative. in addition , id was consulted to provide furtherguidance regarding antimicrobial management. they recommended tocontinue ampicillin and levofloxacin. clindamycin was changed toflagyl. by discharge , the patient was afebrile.3. cardiovascular. by hospital day number two , the patient wasnoted to have increased lower extremity swelling and new bibasilarcrackles. the symptoms were suggestive of volume overload andpossibly congestive heart failure. a chest x-ray was notable forbilateral atelectasis in the lower lobes but no pulmonary edema orpleural effusions. a cardiac echocardiogram revealed normalsystolic function with ejection fraction of approximately 60% andmild left ventricular hypertrophy. the patient was treated withlasix and was aggressively diuresed. she responded well totreatment.4. neurologic. the patient presented with abdominal pain and wasinitially with demerol and vistaril. initially the patient wasonly minimally responsive to treatment , but over time she becamemore responsive. by

the knee. ct done at lh was negative for pe.hospital course by systems: id: the patient was assessed bygeneral surgery in the emergency roomand plastic surgery followed the patient while in-house. it wasthought that the patient did not require any further surgicaldebridement , she is status post two surgical debridements at nch .it was recommended that she undergo wet-to-dry dressing changes.originally upon admission to the irvra hospital she was given nafcillin ,however , after coming up to the floor she was changed to a regimenof vancomycin , cefotan and flagyl as per id recommendation at hom ,this is the regimen the patient was receiving at omh . her bloodcultures , of note , were never positive. it was recommended by theid service that the patient does need an abdominal ct to rule outan abscess given the stranding seen on prior ct at sh , however ,the patient was too large for the ct table at the oale hospital , as wellas for an mri table , it will have to be assessed as to whether thepatient may be transferred to another facility for abdominalimaging to rule out abscess , until that time wet-to-dry dressingswill continue to the wound and antibiotics will be continued iv.endocrine: the patient was given a regimen of nph 14 units b.i.d.and an insulin sliding scale with excellent control of blood sugar.fen: the patient has severe protein calorie malnutrition , and anutrition consult was obtained and extensive conversations werecarried out concerning whether or not to institute tpn or tubefeeds in this patient. the patient originally refused tube feedsand it was explained to her the risks and benefits of tpn , and apicc was placed to institute tpn. however , on 6/6 the patientattempted to leave ama and was declared incompetent to make medicaldecisions , so while tpn was instituted to help support the patientnutritionally , at some point a feeding tube including a permanentpeg will have to be reconsidered , as this is the best way to feedthe patient. her admission albumin was 1.5 , indicative of severeprotein calorie malnutrition , and her severe malnutrition was alsothought to be the contributing , if not causative , factor to thepatient's renal failure.renal: the patient's admission creatinine was 1.2 with an increaseto 1.9 overnight , and continued to rise to a level of 3 throughouther admission. a renal consult was obtained. fena was less than 1percent , so renal felt that the patient's acute renal failure wasmost likely prerenal secondary to the patient's severe proteincalorie malnutrition at third spacing , so it was thought that thepatient would benefit from transfusions of blood products and/oralbumin to help pull fluid intravascularly. there was some thoughtthat perhaps her renal failure could have been due ain fromnafcillin , however , her urine eos were negative. the patient didhave polyuria from yeast but this was thought to be colonizationand not actual infection. the patient did continue to receive ivfluids throughout this hospitalization , and her electrolytes weremonitored and repleted as necessary.gi: the patient did have some diarrhea , a c. diff was sent and iscurrently negative.psychiatry: there were severe behavior problems with the patientat amc resulting in the necessity of maintain an elaborate carecontract with the patient that details each behavior that wasexpected of the patient. however , throughout her stay at gh ,though she was thought to have a severely regressed personalitydisorder , she was deemed competent to make medical decisions andthus left ama from that facility. upon arrival to wrangwake medical center , she did express suicidal ideations to her niece , so apsychiatric consult was obtained. however , psychiatry felt likeher suicidal ideation was most likely indicative of a borderlinetype personality disorder , so it was not thought that she wasactively suicidal and did not require a one to one sitter.however , she did continue to have manipulative behavior and severemedical noncompliance , refusing all care including basic hygieniccare as well as wound dressings , medications , and interviews withcare providers and other medically necessary interventions. thepatient refused multiple evaluations by psychiatry to evaluate forcompetence as the patient often did not want to listen whenattempts to explain to her her medical problems and theconsequences concerning medical decisions were attempted. finallyon october , the patient did try to leave ama during the night ,and on the morning of march another psychiatric evaluation wasperformed and the patient was declared incompetent by psychiatry ,and the decision was made to proceed with medically necessary caredespite the patient's unwillingness to comply , and we have begunthe pursuit of her guardianship for this patient. the patient'ssister has agreed to pursue the role as her guardian. until thattime , the patient will be restrained physically or chemically asnecessary for medically necessary intervention. psychiatry iscontinuing to follow.current medications include: flagyl 500 mg iv q.8. , cefotan 1 g ivq.24. , vancomycin dose by levels ,heparin 5000

however , there was no common bile duct dilatationand no pseudocyst or evidence of necrosis in the pancreas.assessment: this is a 70-year-old woman with a history ofhypertension who presented with acute abdominal pain and anabdominal ct consistent with pancreatitis with gallstones in thegallbladder , but without evidence of obstruction.hospital course by problem:1. gi: pancreatitis diagnosed by clinical picture. laboratoryvalues on ct findings on admission with no evidence of pseudocystor necrosis or other surgical complications of pancreatitis.though likely etiology for pancreatitis was gallstone given thatthere were gallstones seen on her abdominal ct and that she hadelevation of some of her lfts. she did go on to have a rightupper quadrant ultrasound to reevaluate. the common bile ductlooked not dilated , but right at the upper limits of normal.given this borderline values she was also sent for mrcp to ruleout cbd dilatation in the event that she may need cholecystectomyin the future. the mrcp showed again no evidence of obstructionof the duct and no evidence of cholecystitis. she was treatedwith aggressive iv fluid hydration for the first several days ofadmission. pain controlled with morphine , and was kept n.p.o.for several days until her pain improved. at this time , her ivfluids were gradually decreased , and her diet was graduallyadvanced as tolerated. by the time of discharge , she wastolerating a regular diet without any recurrence of her abdominalpain , nausea , or vomiting , and was not requiring any further painmedication. her lfts , amylase , and lipase normalized within afew days of treatment early in the hospitalization. she was alsomaintained on iv b.i.d. h2 blocker , and then discharged to homeon p.o. pepcid. given her stated history of heartburn. she wasgiven an appointment to follow up with the th general surgeryclinic for evaluation for likely cholecystectomy and instructedthat this would be her plan of care after discharge.2. cardiovascular. in terms of ischemia , the patient did havesome t-wave flattening diffusely on her ekg; however , had nochest pain. this is likely related to her hypokalemia onpresentation. she did rule out for an mi with 3 sets of negativeenzymes and had no ekg changes or telemetry changes concerningfor ischemia and no bouts of chest pain throughout her admission.in terms of pump , she was aggressively fluid rehydrated , givenher dehydration on admission , and her diagnosis of pancreatitis ,but did not have any signs of fluid overload at any point duringher hospitalization , and was returned to all p.o. diet withoutneed for iv fluids prior to discharge. her blood pressure waswell controlled originally with her home medication of norvascand then with a change to lopressor in order to obtain good ratecontrol as well without bouts of hypertension throughout thisadmission. in terms of rhythm , the patient did have someepisodes of likely atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrialtachycardia on telemetry early in her admission. these episodeswould last only a few seconds and resolved spontaneously and thepatient did not have symptoms from these. this was thought to belikely related to her acute illness and her hypokalemia onadmission. however , she was started on lopressor for better ratecontrol , which was up titrated as needed with good effect. bythe time of discharge , she had had no events on telemetry forgreater than 36 hours. she was discharged on new medication oftoprol to control her rate and also taking the place of hernorvasc for her blood pressure control.3. id. the patient did have a low-grade temperature onadmission , but this was likely related to her inflammation.blood cultures x2 drawn at the time of admission were negative.the chest x-ray was negative for any growth and finalized beforedischarge. chest x-ray was negative for any evidence ofpneumonia and a urinalysis was negative. she was not started onany antibiotics throughout the admission.4. hematology. the patient has underlying anemia with anunclear baseline hematocrit given her infrequent labs at thisinstitution. her hematocrit was stable between 31 and 36throughout her hospitalization here and recommended that shefollows up with her primary care provider for furtherinstructions on her anemia.5. fluids , electrolytes , nutrition. the patient was initiallyaggressively fluid rehydrated and then changed to maintenance ivfluids. thus , her diet was advanced. potassium and magnesiumwere repeated as needed with electrolytes originally checkedtwice per day until stabilized. she was originally maintainedn.p.o. and then her diet was gradually advanced as her symptomstolerated to a house diet before discharge.6. prophylaxis. the patient was maintained on iv b.i.d. , pepcidfor gi prophylaxis , and lovenox for dvt prophylaxis.7. code status. the patient is dnr/dni.discharge plan: the patient is discharged to home with avisiting nurse to check in on her for medication management ,nutrition , and home safety evaluation. she has followupappointments with her primary care provider , dr. gahring , andalso with the fnh general surgery clinic regarding possiblecholecystectomy. she was instructed not to take her norvasc anymore and to take instead the toprol. also , she was instructed tocall her physician for any new bouts of abdominal pain , fevers ,or any other worrisome symptoms.discharge medications:1. toprol-xl 100 mg per day.2. pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.3. diovan 80 mg p.o. daily.4. premarin 0.9 mg p.o. daily ( however , it is recommended thather pcp consider weaning off this medication given its knownrisks and recent evidence-based literature , and also given thepossible risk of gallstones of this medication ).escription document: 9-3466454 nffocusdictated by: pascucci , johnieattending: rohdenburg , leonardo oliverdictation id 9310255d: 8/7/06t: 2/18/06",1

surgery in 1989 forvaricosities of the lower extremities. social history: she deniestobacco , ethanol or drug use.physical examination: revealed an obese white female in milddistress. the pupils are equal , round andreactive to light and accommodation; fundi well visualized , nopapilledema. good facial movements. no oral lesions. the chestwas clear. the heart showed a regular rate and rhythm. theabdomen was soft and nontender with a fetal heart rate in the140's. the extremities showed trace edema. the neuro exam showedcranial nerves ii-xii grossly intact. reflexes were 1+ withoutclonus. the strength was reduced to 4/5 in the right upper andright lower extremities , however , the exam was questionable as sheseemed to have a varying exam depending on the examiner and time ofexam. she also demonstrated decreased fine finger movements on theright.hospital course: problem #1 ) headache. the patient has a historyof chronic headaches for which she was maintainedon fioricet in the past. over the first week of hospitalization ,she complained of increasing headache that prevented her fromlooking into the light as well as prevented her from ambulating outof the bed. at times , she complained of intermittent visualsymptoms. these headaches were not completely relieved by demerol ,percocet or tylenol. she was eventually tried on fioricet whichapparently produced good relief of the headaches. she was seen byneurology and noted with a questionably abnormal neuro exam withfindings localized to the right side. apparently she has a historyof this abnormality in the past. a ct scan revealed what wasapparently old damage from the previous motor vehicle accident. anmri was entirely within normal limits. she refused a lumbarpuncture. at this time , the headaches are thought to be eithervascular in origin or psychogenic. she was continued on fioricetat the time of discharge. problem #2 ) hypertension. she hadelevated blood pressures of 150-160 over as high as 110 uponadmission. she has a history of chronic hypertension in the pastand was at least briefly maintained on hydrochlorothiazide before.she had a negative work up for pet , including repeat 24 hour urinesand repeat pet labs. as well , she had no physical findingsconsistent with pet. given her history of chronic hypertension , wefelt this was most likely chronic hypertension aggravated bypregnancy. she was begun on a beta blocker , namely labetolol , withgood control. she was discharged to home on labetolol. problem#3 ) history of seizure disorder. she carries the diagnosis of aseizure disorder , although this is , at least recently , poorlydocumented. she has been on valproic acid in the past and has beentaking a small dose of valproic acid apparently on her ownthroughout this pregnancy. she has been taking 250 mg a week. shelast noted an obvious seizure three years ago. it is not clearthat this was witnessed by anyone else. while in the hospital , shehad an eeg which suggested some slowing in the right parietalregion. there was no clear seizure activity seen on eeg. shecalled us to her room on several episodes which she described asseizures. these seizures were witnessed by several physicians andwere remarkable for absence of a postictal period as well asabnormal idiosyncratic behaviors during the events. it was ourfeeling that these were not true seizures. indeed , reviewing herchart , she has had episodes of what have been called pseudoseizuressimilar to these in the past. given her multiple drug allergies ,including dilantin , phenobarb and tegretol , we felt limited in ourtherapeutic options. we did elect to increase her dose of valproicacid as this has apparently been effective in the past. she willcontinue this as an outpatient. problem #4 ) nausea and vomiting.she complained of persistent nausea and vomiting during the latterpart of her hospitalization and declined to take anything p.o. theetiology of this nausea and vomiting was unclear , althoughapparently associated with some diarrhea. as much as was possible ,work up for an organic cause of the problem was negative. weelected initially to treat her with intravenous hydration , however ,she declined further iv's. in fact , she became quite vocal in herdemand to go home. she understands our concerns as to the risks ofpoor p.o. intake and insists she will be able to take in p.o.'s athome. given her feelings in this regard , we have elected todischarge her for a trial of outpatient management. follow up willbe in the clinic. should she show evidence of compromise ordehydration , she will be readmitted. problem #5 ) psychosocial.the patient has been seen several times in the past for behavioraldisorders. it is difficult to sort out what part of hersymptomatology is organic and what , if any , is inorganic. she wasseen by psychiatry during her stay here who felt that she had asignificant conflict in her home life. we have counseled her asmuch as possible throughout her stay. she has seen both socialservices and psychiatry , however , she is at best reluctant to availherself of these services. our plan at the time of discharge isfor follow up with dss. as well , we have emphasized ouravailability to the patient at all times and tried to be assupportive as possible in these circumstances.disposition: the patient was discharged for a trial of managementat home. the etiology of her discomfort is somewhatobscure , however , we have as best as possible ruled out obviousmajor organic pathology , including pet , central cns processes andfulminant hypertension.discharge diagnoses: 1. intrauterine pregnancy at 24 weeks.2. headache.3. seizure disorder.4. chronic hypertension.5. rule out pre-eclamptic toxemia.6. nausea and

electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 62with no signs of acute ischemia.chest x-ray is clear.hospital course ( by system ): ( 1 ) gastrointestinal: the patientwas admitted to the surgical servicefor , likely , cholecystis , and managed medically. he was maden.p.o. , and hydrated with intravenous fluids and started on tripleantibiotics including ampicillin , gentamicin , and flagyl. thepatient remained afebrile with a normal white blood countthroughout his hospital course on the surgical service. however ,his alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin became elevated andthe gastroenterology medical service was consulted forconsideration of ercp. the patient then underwent ercp on march , 1999 , where a distal common bile duct stone was noted , and anattempt at removal of the stone was made. however , the stone couldnot be extracted. therefore , the procedure was aborted , and thepatient was transferred to the medical service for furthermanagement. the patient's liver function tests remained stableafter the attempt of the common bile duct stone removal , and hecontinued to remain pain free and afebrile. given the observationof a common bile duct stone , the gi service thought it appropriateto take the patient back for repeat ercp two days later. repeatercp showed that there was no residual stone , and no additionalstones were noted. the patient was then advanced on hisdiet , which he tolerated with no further symptoms. the patientcontinued to be followed by the surgical service who recommended ,then , an elective cholecystectomy as an outpatient at a later date.( 2 ) cardiovascular: given the patient's history of coronary arterydisease , a cardiology consult was obtained by the surgical service ,who then continued to follow the patient once he was transferred tothe medical service. preoperative evaluation for possiblecholecystectomy was performed , and it was noted that the patient'scoronary artery disease included the following history: thepatient had a coronary catheterization in 1995 , which revealed a 30percent left anterior descending artery , proximal as well as midstenosis , as well clean circumflex , 70 to 90 percent obtusemarginal lesion , and a 40 percent , 40 percent , and 70 percentserial right coronary artery lesions , as well as a 70 percentposterior descending artery lesion. at that time , obtuse marginalangioplasty was performed. an left ventriculogram revealed anejection fraction of 69 percent at the time. in january 1996 , thepatient had an exercise tolerance test , in which the patient wentsix minutes and 30 seconds with 1 millimeter st depressions , whichwere highly predictive of ischemia , but the patient had nosymptoms , and he refused intervention at that time.the cardiology consult concluded that given the patient's historyof coronary artery disease , a recommendation was made to perform anuclear imaging study to assess the patient's ischemic risk for acholecystectomy. an exercise tolerance test mibi was performed , inwhich the patient had a good work load. however , moderate tosevere inferoapical ischemia was noted on mibi images. given theurgent need for ercp during this hospital course , catheterizationwas postponed , and the patient remained chest pain free and symptomfree throughout his hospital course from a cardiology perspective.he was continued on medications , which included lopressor ,lisinopril , and diltiazem. persistent hypertension was controlledby increasing the dose of beta blocker with good response. aspirinwas held secondary to consideration of ercp and the possibility ofgastrointestinal bleed. given that the patient remained symptomfree from a cardiac standpoint , cardiology consult decided that thepatient's cardiac catheterization would be deferred until afterthis hospitalization , in light of the possible complications ofadding a tb3a antagonist during percutaneous transluminal coronaryangioplasty in the context of possible ercp. therefore , thepatient will be followed up in cardiology for electivecatheterization.( 3 ) endocrine: the patient's diabetes was well controlled with hisinsulin regimen , which was held while he was n.p.o. , as well as onan insulin sliding scale.( 4 ) infectious disease: the patient remained afebrile throughouthis hospital course , but was continued on ampicillin , gentamicin ,and flagly per surgery recommendations.discharge medications: ( 1 ) aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.( 2 ) nph insulin subcutaneous 50 unitsq.a.m. ( 3 ) regular insulin subcutaneous 10

persistent chest discomfort , shortness of breath. shegenerally describes it in her anterior chest wall as pressure , butthere is also some sharp qualities as well. the patient has alsonoted increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea without subjectivewheezing and there has been an increase in her orthopnea. thepatient is unsure of whether her shortness of breath correlateswith her chest pressure. previous evaluation has included severalnegative exercise tolerance tests , but there was in 1981 anexercise tolerance test with thallium that showed a fixed anteriorprofusion defect and an

scan given her sedentary life style to rule outpulmonary embolus , and in fact it was very low probability. thepatient at that point was managed by the addition of agastrointestinal regimen of prilosec and cisapride as she hadcomplained of some worsening of her chest pressure when she laidback flat and some sour taste in her mouth. the patient reportedthat this combination of medications

claall onli medical center surgical service on1/12/05 for management of her intraabdominal abscesses as acomplication of recently performed partial colectomy and hartmannpouch for perforated diverticulitis. she was started on ivantibiotics with vancomycin , levofloxacin , and flagyl. bysystems.neuro: the patient had intermittent issues with pain control ,which were managed by putting the patient on oral narcotic agentsas well as fentanyl patch. this seemed to help the patient'spain. the patient also had an episode of altered mental status ,which was believed to be due to pulmonary issues of co2 retentionas noted below. for this reason , the patient had beentransferred to the icu for 24-hour period observation , and at thetime of discharge , the patient was in adequate mental statuscommunicating effectively and at her baseline. otherwise , noissues at the time of discharge , except for pain control , beingmanaged by narcotic agents.cardiovascular: the patient was stable throughout herhospitalization. however , it was notable at the time of herprevious admission that the patient would need to undergo anechocardiogram within one to two weeks. for this reason , thepatient underwent an echocardiogram during her hospitalizationand was found to have normal ejection fraction of 65%. therewere no regional wall motion abnormalities noted. her aorticvalve showed trace aortic insufficiency and the patient also hadmild degree of aortic stenosis with the valve of 1.4 cm squared.her mitral valve was shown to have some degree of mitralregurgitation and the patient also had some tricuspidregurgitation as well. her right ventricle was seemed to be okayand she did have some evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.no evidence of gross cardiac dysfunction.pulmonary: the patient on hospital day #6 was found to havealtered mental status in the evening. an abg was checked , whichshowed a ph of 7.42 , pco2 of 61 , and po2 of 58 , 92% oxygensaturation on 3 to 4 liters with the base access of 12. for thisreason , it was determined that the patient would need to beadmitted to the surgical icu for further monitoring of herpulmonary status. she was taken to the icu and admitted there.during her icu course , the patient was placed on bipap , whicheffectively brought her bicarbonate and her pco2 levels down.this did effectively decrease her pco2. hence by hospital day#8 , the patient was transferred back to the floor in stablecondition. from her pulmonary standpoint , the patient continuedto have some degree of bibasilar crackles during herhospitalization. however , given her otherwise stable status , thepatient was encouraged to perform and sent to spirometry andlasix was withheld during the later course of her hospitalcourse. at the time of discharge , the patient was with adequateoxygen saturation sating 97% on 1 liter at the time of discharge.gi: the patient had no trouble eating regular diet during herhospital course. her ostomy continued to function well with thestoma pink and healthy. she did have two intraabdominalabscesses , which were drained on hospital day #2 byinterventional radiology. two ir catheters were placed and thesewere left in place until the output was deemed to be minimal , anda ct scan was performed as well as an abscessogram , both of whichreveled that the fluid collections had resolved. hence onhospital day #10 , the patient's interventional radiology drainswere discontinued without complications. at the time ofdischarge , the patient was stable with a soft abdomen and noevidence of infection. the patient did have a midline abdominalincision open with pink granulation tissue , healing well. thepain was treated with wet-to-dry normal saline dressing , b.i.d.to t.i.d.gu: the patient continued to have good urine output during herhospital course. she did require foley placement from adequatemonitoring of her urine output at 1.8. urinalysis , as well asurine culture was sent , which revealed yeast greater than 100 , 000yeast , not candida albicans. she was started on a five-daycourse of fluconazole and her foley catheter was discontinued fortreatment of this infection. at the time of discharge , thepatient was urinating adequate amounts independently without anyissues.heme: the patient's hematocrit remained stable during herhospital course. however , during her stay in the icu , hematocritwas found to be 27 and the patient received 1 unit of packed redblood cells without any complications or events. at the time ofdischarge , the patient's hematocrit was found to be 43 withoutany event. she continued to receive subcutaneous heparin t.i.d.for dvt prophylaxis.id: the patient was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin , andflagyl during her hospital course for the intraabdominalabscesses. fluconazole was also added for the treatment of aurinary tract infection with the yeast. the antibiotics werecontinued until the drains were removed on hospital day #10. onhospital day #10 , the patient was transitioned to levofloxacin ,which is to be continued for a 10-day total course benign1/27/05 , 10 further days of levofloxacin required for adequatecovered. however , it should be noted that the ir drains werefound to be negative and only revealed purulent fluid. gramstain was indicative of sterile purulent fluid. cultures

in 6/24 showed that atrialappendage thrombus and trace mitral regurgitation.2. hyperprolactinemia.3. hypercholesterolemia.4. chest ct in 9/19 showed multiple tiny nodules in the rightupper lobe that needed to be followed up in 6-12 months.brief history of present illness: the patient is a 52-year-oldmale with a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and atrialflutter , status post multiple cardioversion and failed ablations ,admitted electively for repeat ablation of his atrial flutter.he was initially diagnosed with atrial fibrillation about 12years ago and had multiple failed cardioversion and medicationtrials. he underwent several atrial fibrillation ablations ,which ultimately all failed. overtime his atrial fibrillationhas become atrial flutter possibly due to scarring of the atrialwall and repeated ablations. when he was first diagnosed withatrial fibrillation he was started on coumadin , but that gave himskin necrosis around his right scapular region. he had been allthe anticoagulants until 6/24 when during transesophageal echofor planned ablation he was found to have a left atrial appendageclot. he was first started on lovenox , which caused largeecchymosis , which prompted him to switch anticoagulation thefondaparinux. he now lived persistently in atrial flutter. hisweight controlled with acebutolol. his physical activity hassomewhat decreased and he occasionally gets short of breath ,epigastric discomfort , and palpitations. he was admitted on7/6/06 for planned atrial flutter ablation by dr. bockemehl anddr. caddle however , a preprocedure transesophageal echoagain demonstrated a left atrial appendage thrombus despite beingon fondaparinux , instead the patient underwent permanent atrialfibrillation and atrial flutter surgery , which included a fourthsternotomy and ablation of atrial fibrillation with cox iii mazewith cryoablation and cut and sew resection of the left and rightatrial appendages and closure of a patent foramen ovale.preadmission medications: included lipitor 40 mg orally daily ,acebutolol 200 mg orally daily , bromocriptine 7.5 mg orallydaily , and fondaparinux 10 mg subcutaneously daily.social history: the patient has no tobacco use , no alcoholabuse , and no illicit drug use.allergies: the patient has allergies to quinidine , coumadin towhich he has a skin necrosis allergy , flecainide which he hasquestionable syncope , and amiodarone in which he developedabnormal liver function test.admission physical exam: the patient was alert and oriented x3.he was in no acute distress. his lungs are clear bilaterally toauscultation. his cardiovascular exam demonstrated regular rateand rhythm with a normal s1 and s2. there were no murmurs , rubs ,or gallops. his abdomen was obese. bowel sounds are

underwentfourth sternotomy ablation of atrial fibrillation with cox iiimaze with cryoablation and cut and sew resection of the left andright atrial appendages , closure of patent foramen ovale.surgery was performed by dr. rosendo schwabaueradditional procedures: the patient underwent cardiaccatheterization on 8/9/06 , which showed that he was right heartdominant that the left main coronary artery had no significantlesions. the left anterior descending artery had no significantlesion. the left circumflex artery proximally showed a tubular25% lesion and the right coronary artery showed no

restarted her torsemide and increased her doseof lisinopril. this resulted in a bump of her bun and creatinineback up to around 2.8 from 1.9. because she diuresed a total ofabout 300 cc that day , we presumed this bump was due to increasedose of lisinopril. we decreased the dose back to 10 mg b.i.d. andcontinued her torsemide. the patient's bun and creatininestabilized then at 63 and 2.8. because

showed no growth of any organism.2. pulmonary: the patient had a history of left upper lobe lungcancer status post resection. the patient was continued on herflovent for management of likely copd. she underwent a chest ctduring this admission , which showed no evidence a mass orrecurrence of her lung cancer.3. ischemia: the patient was found to have a troponin as highas 23 during this admission and ruled in for a non-nstemi in thesetting of hypoxemia. the patient was continued on aspirin ,statin beta-blocker and ace inhibitor. she underwent adobutamine mibi on 5/18/05 , which showed areas of periinfarctischemia most prominent at the anterior wall. the patient thenunderwent a cardiac catheterization on 11/29/05 , which showedleft main disease at 50% as well as tight left circumferentiallad and a 100% rca lesion. the patient was then evaluated forcabg in light of her three-vessel coronary artery disease. dueto her multiple comorbidities , she underwent a preoperativeevaluation with the chest ct , carotid ultrasound , pulmonaryfunction test , and echocardiogram. the chest ct revealed noevidence of lung cancer recurrence. carotid ultrasound wassignificant for bilateral ica stenosis at

chronicobstructive pulmonary disease who is followed by dr. jerald fennermost recently , she was admitted on 8/5/92 for a chronicobstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation which was treated withaggressive bronchodilators. her baseline abg on discharge was7.39 , pc02 51.1 , and a p02 of 66 with 91.3% 02 saturation. she hada previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. hermost

bundlebranch block , inverted t's in v1 and v2 , but no significant changecompared with 11/1hospital course: the patient was admitted and continued on theventilator until 3/6/93. she was given aggressivebronchodilator treatment via nebulizers , albuterol and atropent.she was started on iv solu-medrol dose which was rapidly tapered ona p.o. schedule. she also received two days of iv ceftriaxone tocover a possible tracheobronchitis. she was also continued on herancef as well. her urinary tract infection was treated via theceftriaxone. she did well over the next two days and essentiallywas ready for extubation on this regimen on 3/6/93. she waswatched overnight and did continue to do well , and was transferredto the floor on 6/14/93. by this time , her 02 saturations were 92%on two liters. she was afebrile , and her peak flows were improvingwith continued albuterol nebulizers and atrovent inhaler. herpolymyalgia rheumatica remained stable during her admission. therewas a question whether or not her urinary tract infection wasadequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000colonies of staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. thesewere clean catches. she had it repeated one more time as a cleancatch , and this was found to grow probable pseudomonas species ,with an exact speciation pending. this last culture on 5/17/93 wasassociated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. becauseof this and because of the low cell count , i did not feel that itwas necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cathspecimen was obtained. the patient was informed that if herdysuria were to persist that she was to call dr. gigger immediately ,but that otherwise , her urine was most likely noninfected. shealso received a sleep study on 1/16/93 which revealed that heroxygen saturations dropped to 46% during rem sleep. this was at apoint when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had anelement of essential sleep apnea. she also during periods ofnon-rem sleep alternated between breathing against an obstructionand not breathing at all. this revealed that she also has acomponent of obstructive sleep apnea as well. she was started onprogesterone as an outpatient and will continue to be followed forevaluation for possible nasal c-pap. the patient was discharged on8/19/93 with a continued good airflow and much fewer wheezes thanpreviously. there were no complications.disposition: discharge medications: progesterone 20 mg p.o.t.i.d. , albuterol 0.5 cc in 2.5 normal saline q4hours p.r.n. , atrovent

werebradycardia , twin #1 , in triage; absent fetal cardiac activity in#2; and 34 weeks gestational age with mo/di twins. postoperativediagnoses were listed as chorioamnionitis , diabetes , and demiseof twin #2. the findings were consistent with a live born maleinfant apgars 5 and 8; a stillborn male infant , apgars 0 and 0;and intact placenta and a foul-smelling amniotic fluid with lightmeconium in twin #1. there were no complications.her postpartum course was highly complicated by several issuesthat will be dealt with by system. in short , she suffered a vfibarrest in the setting of the dic , potential sepsis , potentialhellp syndrome , and was admitted to the medical intensive careunit and intubated. ultimately , she was discharged from themedical intensive care unit and was monitored on the labor floorand then was transferred to postpartum where she continued torecover and regain function until postoperative day #12 when shewas discharged home with vna in stable condition. her issueswill be dealt with by system.1. cardiology. within 3 hours following her for stat cesareansection , she presented with acute onset of shortness of breath ,chest discomfort in the setting of a postpartum hemorrhage.telemetry was applied and had evidence of widening qrs complexes ,and ultimately , she went into vfib arrest with pulselesselectrical activity. she underwent aggressive resuscitation inthe form of 2 shocks with epinephrine following the code blue.she was brought back to the operating room where chem-7 revealedpotassium of 7 which may have been the etiology of this vfibarrest. a pulse was obtained following the 2 shocks andepinephrine , and she was intubated to clear her airway. she wasthen transferred to the medical intensive care unit where cardiacenzymes were followed for 4 total sets and were found to begrossly positive. the impression of her positive cardiac enzymesthat did trend downwords was that it was secondary to theaggressive chest compressions and were felt not likely to lead tosignificant myocardial injury. an echocardiogram that wasobtained on postoperative day #2 while she was admitted to themedical intensive care unit revealed no evidence of focal wallmotion abnormalities and showed that the overall left ventricularfunction was normal with an ef of 55%. of note , throughout hermicu admission , she was tachycardic to 120s to 140s , and thiswas ascribed to her marked amounts of postpartum hemorrhage inthe setting of possible chorioamnionitis with sepsis. thistachycardia resolved by postoperative day #6 , and bypostoperative day #12 , she was no longer tachycardia with a heartrate in the 80's.her blood pressure while in the initial postpartum period wasmaintained in the normal range , began to become elevated bypostoperative day #8 , and she was started on postoperative day#10 on her labetalol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. this controlled herhypertension throughout the remainder of her hospital course , andshe was discharged home on labetalol.2. hematology. following her stat cesarean section , sheunderwent a postpartum hemorrhage with an estimated hemorrhage of5-6 l of blood from her vagina. this dissection itself had only700 cc blood loss. at this time , her fibrinogen was appreciatedto be 78 and her coags were markedly elevated. in the setting ofdic , she underwent an aggressive product resuscitation andultimately she received 20 units of packed red blood cells , 7units of fresh frozen plasma , 3 pools of platelets , 1200 mcg ofactivated factor 7a , 2 units of cryoprecipitate , 4 units of 5%albumin , and 1 bag of hespan within a timeframe of 3 to 6 hours.with this aggressive resuscitation , her hematocrit dropped to aslow as 26.4 , but we within 2 hours , had increased to 61.3.acutely following this episode after her aggressiveresuscitation , her fibrinogen increased from its low of 87 to337. her dic continued to be low-grade , even after beingdischarged from the medical intensive care unit. for thisreason , she was monitored on the labor floor for an additionalday postoperative day #4 , and her coagulation studies ranged froman inr of 1.2 to 1.4. when she was admitted to postpartum , herinr was 1.1 , and the day before discharge from the hospital , hercoagulation studies were found to be normal with an inr of 1.1and fibrinogen of 377.her platelets became an area of concern when she presented with aplatelet level that was found to be fluctuating between 90 and185. in the initial presentation after her postpartumhemorrhage. her platelets while in the medical intensive careunit went to as low as 57 , and this was felt to be possibly acomponent of her hellp syndrome versus dilution from her bloodproduct resuscitation also part of her dic consumptivecoagulopathy. although her dic consumptive coagulopathy hadevidence that it had resolved , her platelets remained low andreached another low postoperative #7 when they became 69. ahematology consult was obtained to evaluate the possible causesof her low platelets , and she underwent an extensive evaluationincluding a negative anticardiolipin and a negative lupusanticoagulant. the impression was one of low platelets secondaryto shock liver in addition to dic in addition to dilution withmarked amounts of blood products , especially in the setting ofthe hematocrit ranging from the 49 to 50 range at that time. herplatelets continued to improve throughout the hospital course andher platelets upon discharge were 144 and had trended up from thelow of 69.her hematocrit initially was found to be very high , uponpresentation at 51. this was consistent with hemoconcentrationwith a trough to as low as 26 while in the medical intensive careunit. following her resuscitation , it went to as high as 61. onpostoperative day #7 , however , it dropped from 46 to 40 and thendropped again to 37.5 upon repeat check. this was of concern but2 subsequent hematocrits were stable in the 39 range. her finalhematocrit on the day of discharge was 39.5. this droppinghematocrit was discovered in the setting of a rectus musclehematoma that will be dealt with elsewhere in the dictation buther hematocrit was stable upon discharge.3. gi. upon presentation , ms. neeb had evidence of increasinglfts. while in the medical intensive care unit , she was found tohave an ast of 177 , alt of 124 , and total bilirubin of 6.2.these elevated liver enzymes in the setting of her low plateletswas suspicious for possible hellp syndrome. these lfts continuedto improve with the ast and alt dropping down to the normallimits. upon discharge , she was appreciated to have an alt of 37and ast of 48. her bilirubin , however , continued to increasefrom 6.2 to as high as 11.2. in the setting of her increasingbilirubin while the other lfts continued to improve , a gi consulwas obtained , and she underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasoundtwo times , once while on the labor floor and once while on thepostpartum floor. both of these revealed a normal liver , normalbiliary tree , as well as normal-sized spleen. in the setting ofa normal nonobstructive picture , the gi consult had theimpression that the increased bilirubin was secondary to hershock liver as well as the multiple blood transfusions andpossible sepsis. they were confident that this would continuedto improve but would likely take 2 to 3 weeks. upon discharge ,her total bilirubin had begun to decrease to 8.2. she didmanifest evidence of jaundice that was improving through thehospital course.on postoperative day #9 , ms. culp developed a marked increase inher amylase and lipase. this was checked in the setting ofincreasing right upper quadrant pain that ultimately resolved.her lipase was elevated to as high as 438 to 474. gi was againreconsulted and had the impression that she did not suffer frompancreatitis given that she had no nausea or vomiting , wastolerating a regular diet , and had resolved abdominal pain. theyfelt that this was likely secondary to post-surgical change andwas not an aggressive process that may need further treatment.an abdominal pelvic ct also demonstrated a normal pancreaswithout any evidence of stranding or pseudocyst formation.the overall impression of the obstetrics team was that herconstellation of acute-onset dic associated withhyperbilirubinemia and low platelets was all consistent with apotential diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. thisdiagnosis is one that can be best made by a liver biopsy anddiscussions with the gi service revealed that they did not feelstrongly that she needed a liver biopsy. the gi service wasskeptical with regard to the diagnosis of acute fatty liver ofpregnancy despite the clinical hallmarks being manifest in thispatient. they felt as if her symptoms could be adequatelyexplained by the degree of shock liver and postpartum hemorrhagethat she experienced. it was unclear as to whether or not shehad acute fatty liver of pregnancy , but given the risk ofrecurrence , she will be counseled as an outpatient with regard tofuture pregnancies and management of these pregnancies , given herhistory of potential acute fatty liver of pregnancy.4. incision. on postoperative day #10 , she developed a darkblood ooze from a 2-mm portion on the right aspect of herpfannenstiel incision. this was concerning for a possiblesubcutaneous hematoma. so an abdominopelvic ct was obtained onpostoperative day #10 that showed evidence of an 8 x 5 cm rightrectus hematoma that may have had an area of tracking through thefascia into the subcutaneous space. it was felt that this couldundergo dressing daily , and would ultimately seal up and stopbleeding. she was discharged home with vna daily dressingchanges and plan to reassess the incision at her followuppostpartum appointment in 4 days from the date of discharge. ofnote , this right rectus hematoma was diagnosed in the setting ofa drop in her hematocrit from 46 to 40. her hematocrit remainedstable for 2 additional days at 39.5.5. infectious disease. on postoperative day #0 , following herstat cesarean section. she had a t-max of 101.9 in the medicalintensive care unit , and ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycinas well as levoflox ofloxacin were started on iv and wascontinued for 6 days until ultimately her blood cultures grew outno organism. the urine cultures were negative and her placentaculture also demonstrated only staphylococcus coagulase negativewith a gram's stain showing no organisms. she remained afebrilefor the remainder of her hospital course and was not dischargedon antibiotics.6. endocrine. initially following her medical intensive careunit admission , her blood sugar remained low throughout the daydespite her eating habits. her blood sugars would get as slow asthe 40s and as high as the 80s. this was perplexing as she wasknown to be type 2 diabetic who initially been managed onmetformin prepregnancy. an endocrine consult was obtained. theconcern was for possible addisonian crisis and cord stimulationtest was normal as well as a.m. and p.m. cortisol levels werechecked. these remained within normal limits , and the concernfor possible sheehan syndrome secondary to her massive postpartumhemorrhage was largely excluded. a tsh as well as an acth levelwhere both drawn , and her tsh was 1.05 in the normal range andthe acth test was 51 , within the normal range. of note , herblood sugars did trend up near the end of her hospital course.on postoperative day #10 , she was found to have fasting sugars inthe 120s. she was restarted on nph 10 units daily. q.p.m. andq.a.m. as well as her humalog sliding scale a.c. she wasdischarged home with prescriptions for nph as well as her humalogand will follow her sugars. these will be followed up by herendocrinologist dr. kuk within 4 days of this discharge.7. renal. while in the medical intensive care unit , shesuffered acute renal failure with a creatinine that went as highas 2.1. this improved to 1.0 upon discharge. of note , she had adecreased sodium appreciated on postoperative day #7. urinaryelectrolytes were drawn and fractional excretion of sodium wasappreciated to be 0.32 consistent with prerenal , and the urineosmolality was 400 consistent with concentrated urine that may ormay not have been consistent with syndrome of inappropriate adh.she underwent fluid restriction for 3 days and her sodiumimproved from 129 to 134 upon discharge.8. pulmonary. immediately following her vfib arrest , she wascomplaining of severe rather shortness of breath and wasintubated on the first attempt. at this time , intubated andsedated , she was in the micu and was extubated on postoperativeday #2. she was transitioned to nasal cannula after being onfio2 of 80% and ultimately was discharged home sating 99 to 100%on room air with a good exercise tolerance.9. infant. their baby boy towery was doing very well upondischarge. he was followed by the pediatric service at chardson medical center and was discharged home with them.10. neuro. initially , her mental status in the medicalintensive care unit would wax and wane. she would beintermittently disoriented. a head ct was obtained postoperativeday #4 , and this was shown to have no focal abnormalitiesalthough there was some indication that there might have beensome stranding between the white and gray matter consistent withpossible edema. this report was not mentioned in the finalreport of the head ct. upon discharge , her mental status was atbaseline with perfect memory of the event leading up to the statcesarean section although she had some difficulty rememberingspecifics with regards to her medical intensive care unitadmission , and the ensuing days. she was alert and oriented toperson , place , and time.11. physical therapy. she underwent a physical therapy consultwith the impression of improving physical status and exercise.she was given exercise strategies that she will continue at home.she was offered home physical therapy but declined as shethought the visiting vna would be adequate and that she was ableto be out of bed with her usual exercise tolerance.disposition: on postoperative day #11 , status post her statcesarean sections for iufd with twins and postpartum hemorrhagedic , she was discharged home with a plan to follow up in the obclinic in 4 days with dr. fred riter and dr. shad brondykeshe will also be seen by dr. durnin of endocrinology. she willhave daily vna dressing changes and was instructed to call if shehad any fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , increased bleeding fromthe incision or if she had any questions.discharge medications:1. colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.2. levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily.3. oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.4. senna tablets 2 tabs p.o. b.i.d.5. simethicone 80 mg p.o. q.i.d.6. labetalol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.7. nph 10 units q.a.m. and q.p.m.8. humalog sliding scale

liver enzymes.7. hypothyroidism.8. a2 gestational diabetes.ultimately she was discharged home with low platelets.throughout her hospital course , she was appreciated to haveevidence of low platelets on her first cbc upon presentation toardma medical center as well as chest compressions , and apulse was once again obtained. in the triage , she was found tohave evidence of a demised twin as well as evidence of a heartrate of the second twin in the 90's.escription document: 2-5532923 hffocus transcriptionistsdictated by: jodha , donnieattending: brett dominic cobbins , m.d. ty98dictation id
